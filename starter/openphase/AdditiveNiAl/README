This is a README file for the AdditiveNiAl example.

In order to run the simulation run ./AdditiveNiAl after the compilation. 
ProjectInput.opi file contains the necessary input for the simulation. 
This example illustrates how one can run phase-field simulation with coupled mass and heat diffusion. 
Two heat sources are incorporated to facilitate cooling and beam melting. 
The user can adjust the heat source values according to the AM process parameters. 
Please note that the units for the heat flux should be in W/m^2.
In the current example, heat source 1 (beam melting) is activated when the temperature falls below 1600k and deactivated when there is 20% liquid in the system.
 
Results will be placed into the ./VTK directory and can be visualised 
using the ParaView (www.paraview.org).
