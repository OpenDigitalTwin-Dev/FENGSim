9.2.31 restart [System Class]
-----------------------------

Class Precedence List::
.......................

restart, t

Description::
.............

An object of type restart represents a function that can be called to
perform some form of recovery action, usually a transfer of control to
an outer point in the running program.

   An implementation is free to implement a restart in whatever manner
is most convenient; a restart has only dynamic extent relative to the
scope of the binding form which establishes it.

9.2.32 compute-restarts [Function]
----------------------------------

‘compute-restarts’ &optional condition ⇒ restarts

Arguments and Values::
......................

condition--a condition object, or nil.

   restarts--a list of restarts.

Description::
.............

compute-restarts uses the dynamic state of the program to compute a list
of the restarts which are currently active.

   The resulting list is ordered so that the innermost (more-recently
established) restarts are nearer the head of the list.

   When condition is non-nil, only those restarts are considered that
are either explicitly associated with that condition, or not associated
with any condition; that is, the excluded restarts are those that are
associated with a non-empty set of conditions of which the given
condition is not an element.  If condition is nil, all restarts are
considered.

   compute-restarts returns all applicable restarts, including anonymous
ones, even if some of them have the same name as others and would
therefore not be found by find-restart when given a symbol argument.

   Implementations are permitted, but not required, to return distinct
lists from repeated calls to compute-restarts while in the same dynamic
environment.  The consequences are undefined if the list returned by
compute-restarts is every modified.

Examples::
..........

      ;; One possible way in which an interactive debugger might present
      ;; restarts to the user.
      (defun invoke-a-restart ()
        (let ((restarts (compute-restarts)))
          (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)) (r restarts (cdr r))) ((null r))
            (format t "~&~D: ~A~
          (let ((n nil) (k (length restarts)))
            (loop (when (and (typep n 'integer) (>= n 0) (< n k))
                    (return t))
                  (format t "~&Option: ")
                  (setq n (read))
                  (fresh-line))

9.2.33 find-restart [Function]
------------------------------

‘find-restart’ identifier &optional condition restart

Arguments and Values::
......................

identifier--a non-nil symbol, or a restart.

   condition--a condition object, or nil.

   restart--a restart or nil.

Description::
.............

find-restart searches for a particular restart in the current dynamic
environment.

   When condition is non-nil, only those restarts are considered that
are either explicitly associated with that condition, or not associated
with any condition; that is, the excluded restarts are those that are
associated with a non-empty set of conditions of which the given
condition is not an element.  If condition is nil, all restarts are
considered.

   If identifier is a symbol, then the innermost (most recently
established) applicable restart with that name is returned.  nil is
returned if no such restart is found.

   If identifier is a currently active restart, then it is returned.
Otherwise, nil is returned.

Examples::
..........

      (restart-case
          (let ((r (find-restart 'my-restart)))
            (format t "~S is named ~S" r (restart-name r)))
        (my-restart () nil))
      |>  #<RESTART 32307325> is named MY-RESTART
     ⇒  NIL

      ≡ (find identifier (compute-restarts) :key :restart-name)

   Although anonymous restarts have a name of nil, the consequences are
unspecified if nil is given as an identifier.  Occasionally, programmers
lament that nil is not permissible as an identifier argument.  In most
such cases, compute-restarts can probably be used to simulate the
desired effect.

‘invoke-restart’ restart &rest arguments ⇒ {result}*

Arguments and Values::
......................

restart--a restart designator.

   argument--an object.

   results--the values returned by the function associated with restart,
if that function returns.

Description::
.............

Calls the function associated with restart, passing arguments to it.

Notes::
.......

The most common use for invoke-restart is in a handler.  It might be
used explicitly, or implicitly through invoke-restart-interactively or a
restart function.

   Restart functions call invoke-restart, not vice versa.  That is,
invoke-restart provides primitive functionality, and restart functions
are non-essential "syntactic sugar."

9.2.35 invoke-restart-interactively [Function]
----------------------------------------------

‘invoke-restart-interactively’ restart ⇒ {result}*

Arguments and Values::
......................

restart--a restart designator.

   results--the values returned by the function associated with restart,
if that function returns.

Description::
.............

invoke-restart-interactively calls the function associated with restart,
prompting for any necessary arguments.  If restart is a name, it must be
valid in the current dynamic environment.

   invoke-restart-interactively prompts for arguments by executing the
code provided in the :interactive keyword to restart-case or
:interactive-function keyword to restart-bind.

   If no such options have been supplied in the corresponding
restart-bind or restart-case, then the consequences are undefined if the
restart takes required arguments.  If the arguments are optional, an
argument list of nil is used.

   Once the arguments have been determined, invoke-restart-interactively
executes the following:

      (apply #'invoke-restart restart arguments)

Examples::
..........

      (defun add3 (x) (check-type x number) (+ x 3))

      (add3 'seven)
      |>  Error: The value SEVEN was not of type NUMBER.
      |>  To continue, type :CONTINUE followed by an option number:
      |>   1: Specify a different value to use.
      |>   2: Return to Lisp Toplevel.
      |>  Debug> |>>(invoke-restart-interactively 'store-value)<<|
      |>  Type a form to evaluate and use: |>>7<<|
     ⇒  10

Side Effects::
..............

If prompting for arguments is necesary, some typeout may occur (on query
I/O).

   A non-local transfer of control might be done by the restart.

Affected By::
.............

*query-io*, active restarts

Exceptional Situations::
........................

9.2.36 restart-bind [Macro]
---------------------------

‘restart-bind’ ({(name function {!key-val-pair}*)}) {form}*
⇒ {result}*

   key-val-pair ::=:interactive-function interactive-function | 
 :report-function report-function |   :test-function test-function

Arguments and Values::
......................

name--a symbol; not evaluated.

   function--a form; evaluated.

   forms--an implicit progn.

   interactive-function--a form; evaluated.

   report-function--a form; evaluated.

   test-function--a form; evaluated.

   results--the values returned by the forms.

Description::
.............

restart-bind executes the body of forms in a dynamic environment where
restarts with the given names are in effect.

   If a name is nil, it indicates an anonymous restart; if a name is a
non-nil symbol, it indicates a named restart.

   The function, interactive-function, and report-function are
unconditionally evaluated in the current lexical and dynamic environment
prior to evaluation of the body.  Each of these forms must evaluate to a
function.

   If invoke-restart is done on that restart, the function which
resulted from evaluating function is called, in the dynamic environment
of the invoke-restart, with the arguments given to invoke-restart.  The
function may either perform a non-local transfer of control or may
return normally.

   If the restart is invoked interactively from the debugger (using
invoke-restart-interactively), the arguments are defaulted by calling
the function which resulted from evaluating interactive-function.  That
function may optionally prompt interactively on query I/O, and should
return a list of arguments to be used by invoke-restart-interactively
when invoking the restart.

   If a restart is invoked interactively but no interactive-function is
used, then an argument list of nil is used.  In that case, the function
must be compatible with an empty argument list.

   If the restart is presented interactively (e.g., by the debugger),
the presentation is done by calling the function which resulted from
evaluating report-function.  This function must be a function of one
argument, a stream.  It is expected to print a description of the action
that the restart takes to that stream.  This function is called any time
the restart is printed while *print-escape* is nil.

   In the case of interactive invocation, the result is dependent on the
value of :interactive-function as follows.

:interactive-function
     Value is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should
     return a function of no arguments which constructs a list of
     arguments to be used by invoke-restart-interactively when invoking
     this restart.  The function may prompt interactively using query
     I/O if necessary.

:report-function
     Value is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should
     return a function of one argument, a stream, which prints on the
     stream a summary of the action that this restart takes.  This
     function is called whenever the restart is reported (printed while
     *print-escape* is nil).  If no :report-function option is provided,
     the manner in which the restart is reported is
     implementation-dependent.

:test-function
     Value is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should
     return a function of one argument, a condition, which returns true
     if the restart is to be considered visible.

Notes::
.......

restart-bind is primarily intended to be used to implement restart-case
and might be useful in implementing other macros.  Programmers who are
uncertain about whether to use restart-case or restart-bind should
prefer restart-case for the cases where it is powerful enough, using
restart-bind only in cases where its full generality is really needed.

9.2.37 restart-case [Macro]
---------------------------

‘restart-case’ restartable-form {!clause} ⇒ {result}*

   clause ::=( case-name lambda-list 
 [[:interactive interactive-expression | :report report-expression | :test test-expression]] 
 {declaration}* {form}*)

Arguments and Values::
......................

restartable-form--a form.

   case-name--a symbol or nil.

   lambda-list--an ordinary lambda list.

   interactive-expression--a symbol or a lambda expression.

   report-expression--a string, a symbol, or a lambda expression.

   test-expression--a symbol or a lambda expression.

   declaration--a declare expression; not evaluated.

   form--a form.

   results--the values resulting from the evaluation of
restartable-form, or the values returned by the last form executed in a
chosen clause, or nil.

Description::
.............

restart-case evaluates restartable-form in a dynamic environment where
the clauses have special meanings as points to which control may be
transferred.  If restartable-form finishes executing and returns any
values, all values returned are returned by restart-case and processing
has completed.  While restartable-form is executing, any code may
transfer control to one of the clauses (see invoke-restart).  If a
transfer occurs, the forms in the body of that clause is evaluated and
any values returned by the last such form are returned by restart-case.
In this case, the dynamic state is unwound appropriately (so that the
restarts established around the restartable-form are no longer active)
prior to execution of the clause.

   If there are no forms in a selected clause, restart-case returns nil.

   If case-name is a symbol, it names this restart.

   It is possible to have more than one clause use the same case-name.
In this case, the first clause with that name is found by find-restart.
The other clauses are accessible using compute-restarts.

   Each arglist is an ordinary lambda list to be bound during the
execution of its corresponding forms.  These parameters are used by the
restart-case clause to receive any necessary data from a call to
invoke-restart.

   By default, invoke-restart-interactively passes no arguments and all
arguments must be optional in order to accommodate interactive
restarting.  However, the arguments need not be optional if the
:interactive keyword has been used to inform
invoke-restart-interactively about how to compute a proper argument
list.

   Keyword options have the following meaning.

:interactive
     The value supplied by :interactive value must be a suitable
     argument to function.  (function value) is evaluated in the current
     lexical environment.  It should return a function of no arguments
     which returns arguments to be used by invoke-restart-interactively
     when it is invoked.  invoke-restart-interactively is called in the
     dynamic environment available prior to any restart attempt, and
     uses query I/O for user interaction.

     If a restart is invoked interactively but no :interactive option
     was supplied, the argument list used in the invocation is the empty
     list.

:report
     If the value supplied by :report value is a lambda expression or a
     symbol, it must be acceptable to function.  (function value) is
     evaluated in the current lexical environment.  It should return a
     function of one argument, a stream, which prints on the stream a
     description of the restart.  This function is called whenever the
     restart is printed while *print-escape* is nil.

     If value is a string, it is a shorthand for

           (lambda (stream) (write-string value stream))

     If a named restart is asked to report but no report information has
     been supplied, the name of the restart is used in generating
     default report text.

     When *print-escape* is nil, the printer uses the report information
     for a restart.  For example, a debugger might announce the action
     of typing a "continue" command by:

           (format t "~&~S -- ~A~

     which might then display as something like:

           :CONTINUE -- Return to command level

     The consequences are unspecified if an unnamed restart is specified
     but no :report option is provided.

:test
     The value supplied by :test value must be a suitable argument to
     function.  (function value) is evaluated in the current lexical
     environment.  It should return a function of one argument, the
     condition, that returns true if the restart is to be considered
     visible.

     The default for this option is equivalent to (lambda (c) (declare
     (ignore c)) t).

   If the restartable-form is a list whose car is any of the symbols
signal, error, cerror, or warn (or is a macro form which macroexpands
into such a list), then with-condition-restarts is used implicitly to
associate the indicated restarts with the condition to be signaled.

..........

   Unnamed restarts are generally only useful interactively and an
interactive option which has no description is of little value.
Implementations are encouraged to warn if an unnamed restart is used and
no report information is provided at compilation time.  At runtime, this
error might be noticed when entering the debugger.  Since signaling an
error would probably cause recursive entry into the debugger (causing
yet another recursive error, etc.)  it is suggested that the debugger
print some indication of such problems when they occur but not actually
signal errors.

9.2.38 restart-name [Function]
------------------------------

‘restart-name’ restart ⇒ name

Arguments and Values::
......................

restart--a restart.

   name--a symbol.

Description::
.............

Returns the name of the restart, or nil if the restart is not named.

Examples::
..........

      (restart-case
          (loop for restart in (compute-restarts)
                    collect (restart-name restart))

        (nil   () :report "Return 2." 2)
        (case3 () :report "Return 3." 3)
        (case1 () :report "Return 4." 4))
     ⇒  (CASE1 NIL CASE3 CASE1 ABORT)
      ;; In the example above the restart named ABORT was not created
      ;; explicitly, but was implicitly supplied by the system.

9.2.39 with-condition-restarts [Macro]
--------------------------------------

‘with-condition-restarts’ condition-form restarts-form {form}*
⇒ {result}*

Arguments and Values::
......................

condition-form--a form; evaluated to produce a condition.

   condition--a condition object resulting from the evaluation of
condition-form.

   restart-form--a form; evaluated to produce a restart-list.

   restart-list--a list of restart objects resulting from the evaluation
of restart-form.

   forms--an implicit progn; evaluated.

   results--the values returned by forms.

Description::
.............

First, the condition-form and restarts-form are evaluated in normal
left-to-right order; the primary values yielded by these evaluations are
respectively called the condition and the restart-list.

   Next, the forms are evaluated in a dynamic environment in which each
restart in restart-list is associated with the condition.  See *note
Associating a Restart with a Condition::.

*note restart-case::

Notes::
.......

Usually this macro is not used explicitly in code, since restart-case
handles most of the common cases in a way that is syntactically more
concise.

9.2.40 with-simple-restart [Macro]
----------------------------------

‘with-simple-restart’ (name format-control {format-argument}*) {form}*
⇒ {result}*

Arguments and Values::
......................

name--a symbol.

   format-control--a format control.

   format-argument--an object (i.e., a format argument).

   forms--an implicit progn.

   results--in the normal situation, the values returned by the forms;
in the exceptional situation where the restart named name is invoked,
two values--nil and t.

Description::
.............

with-simple-restart establishes a restart.

   If the restart designated by name is not invoked while executing
forms, all values returned by the last of forms are returned.  If the
restart designated by name is invoked, control is transferred to
with-simple-restart, which returns two values, nil and t.

   If name is nil, an anonymous restart is established.

   The format-control and format-arguments are used report the restart.

Examples::
..........

      (defun read-eval-print-loop (level)
        (with-simple-restart (abort "Exit command level ~D." level)
          (loop
            (with-simple-restart (abort "Return to command level ~D." level)
              (let ((form (prog2 (fresh-line) (read) (fresh-line))))

Notes::
.......

with-simple-restart is shorthand for one of the most common uses of
restart-case.

   with-simple-restart could be defined by:

      (defmacro with-simple-restart ((restart-name format-control
                                                   &rest format-arguments)
                                     &body forms)
        `(restart-case (progn ,@forms)
           (,restart-name ()
               :report (lambda (stream)
                         (format stream ,format-control ,@format-arguments))
              (values nil t))))

   Because the second return value is t in the exceptional case, it is
common (but not required) to arrange for the second return value in the
normal case to be missing or nil so that the two situations can be
distinguished.

9.2.41 abort [Restart]
----------------------

Data Arguments Required::
.........................

None.

Description::
.............

The intent of the abort restart is to allow return to the innermost
"command level."  Implementors are encouraged to make sure that there is
always a restart named abort around any user code so that user code can
call abort at any time and expect something reasonable to happen;
exactly what the reasonable thing is may vary somewhat.  Typically, in
an interactive listener, the invocation of abort returns to the Lisp
reader phase of the Lisp read-eval-print loop, though in some batch or
multi-processing situations there may be situations in which having it
kill the running process is more appropriate.

9.2.42 continue [Restart]
-------------------------

Data Arguments Required::
.........................

None.

Description::
.............

The continue restart is generally part of protocols where there is a
single "obvious" way to continue, such as in break and cerror.  Some
user-defined protocols may also wish to incorporate it for similar
reasons.  In general, however, it is more reliable to design a special
purpose restart with a name that more directly suits the particular
application.

Examples::
..........

      (let ((x 3))
        (handler-bind ((error #'(lambda (c)
                                  (let ((r (find-restart 'continue c)))
                                    (when r (invoke-restart r))))))
          (cond ((not (floatp x))
                 (cerror "Try floating it." "~D is not a float." x)
                 (float x))
                (t x)))) ⇒  3.0

9.2.43 muffle-warning [Restart]
-------------------------------

Data Arguments Required::
.........................

None.

Description::
.............

This restart is established by warn so that handlers of warning
conditions have a way to tell warn that a warning has already been dealt
with and that no further action is warranted.

Examples::
..........

      (defvar *all-quiet* nil) ⇒  *ALL-QUIET*

9.2.44 store-value [Restart]
----------------------------

Data Arguments Required::
.........................

a value to use instead (on an ongoing basis).

Description::
.............

The store-value restart is generally used by handlers trying to recover
from errors of types such as cell-error or type-error, which may wish to
supply a replacement datum to be stored permanently.

Examples::
..........

      (defun type-error-auto-coerce (c)

                                           (type-error-expected-type c))))
                            (invoke-restart r v))
              (error ()))))) ⇒  TYPE-ERROR-AUTO-COERCE

   ‘continue’ &optional condition ⇒ nil

   ‘muffle-warning’ &optional condition ⇒ #<NoValue>

   ‘store-value’ value &optional condition ⇒ nil

   ‘use-value’ value &optional condition ⇒ nil

Arguments and Values::
......................

value--an object.

   condition--a condition object, or nil.

Description::
.............

Transfers control to the most recently established applicable restart
having the same name as the function.  That is, the function abort
searches for an applicable abort restart, the function continue searches
for an applicable continue restart, and so on.

   If no such restart exists, the functions continue, store-value, and
use-value return nil, and the functions abort and muffle-warning signal
an error of type control-error.

   When condition is non-nil, only those restarts are considered that
are either explicitly associated with that condition, or not associated
with any condition; that is, the excluded restarts are those that are
associated with a non-empty set of conditions of which the given
condition is not an element.  If condition is nil, all restarts are
considered.

Side Effects::
..............

A transfer of control may occur if an appropriate restart is available,
or (in the case of the function abort or the function muffle-warning)
execution may be stopped.

Affected By::
.............

Each of these functions can be affected by the presence of a restart
having the same name.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

If an appropriate abort restart is not available for the function abort,
or an appropriate muffle-warning restart is not available for the
function muffle-warning, an error of type control-error is signaled.

10.2.1 symbol [System Class]
----------------------------

Class Precedence List::
.......................

symbol, t

Description::
.............

Symbols are used for their object identity to name various entities in
Common Lisp, including (but not limited to) linguistic entities such as
variables and functions.

   Symbols can be collected together into packages.  A symbol is said to
be interned in a package if it is accessible in that package; the same
symbol can be interned in more than one package.  If a symbol is not
interned in any package, it is called uninterned.

   An interned symbol is uniquely identifiable by its name from any
package in which it is accessible.

   Symbols have the following attributes.  For historically reasons,
these are sometimes referred to as cells, although the actual internal
representation of symbols and their attributes is
implementation-dependent.

Name
     The name of a symbol is a string used to identify the symbol.
     Every symbol has a name,

     and the consequences are undefined if that name is altered.

     The name is used as part of the external, printed representation of
     the symbol; see *note Character Syntax::.  The function symbol-name
     returns the name of a given symbol.

     A symbol may have any character in its name.

Package
     The object in this cell is called the home package of the symbol.
     If the home package is nil, the symbol is sometimes said to have no
     home package.

     When a symbol is first created, it has no home package.  When it is
     first interned, the package in which it is initially interned
     becomes its home package.  The home package of a symbol can be
     accessed by using the function symbol-package.

     If a symbol is uninterned from the package which is its home
     package, its home package is set to nil.  Depending on whether
     there is another package in which the symbol is interned, the
     symbol might or might not really be an uninterned symbol.  A symbol
     with no home package is therefore called apparently uninterned.

     The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to alter the
     home package of a symbol external in the COMMON-LISP package or the
     KEYWORD package.

Property list
     The property list of a symbol provides a mechanism for associating
     named attributes with that symbol.  The operations for adding and
     removing entries are destructive to the property list.  Common Lisp
     provides operators both for direct manipulation of property list
     objects (e.g., see getf, remf, and symbol-plist) and for implicit
     manipulation of a symbol's property list by reference to the symbol
     (e.g., see get and remprop).  The property list associated with a
     fresh symbol is initially null.

Value
     If a symbol has a value attribute, it is said to be bound, and that
     fact can be detected by the function boundp.  The object contained
     in the value cell of a bound symbol is the value of the global
     variable named by that symbol, and can be accessed by the function
     symbol-value.  A symbol can be made to be unbound by the function
     makunbound.

     The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to change the
     value of a symbol that names a constant variable, or to make such a
     symbol be unbound.

Function
     If a symbol has a function attribute, it is said to be fbound, and
     that fact can be detected by the function fboundp.  If the symbol
     is the name of a function in the global environment, the function
     cell contains the function, and can be accessed by the function
     symbol-function.  If the symbol is the name of either a macro in
     the global environment (see macro-function) or a special operator
     (see special-operator-p), the symbol is fbound, and can be accessed
     by the function symbol-function, but the object which the function
     cell contains is of implementation-dependent type and purpose.  A
     symbol can be made to be funbound by the function fmakunbound.

     The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to change the
     functional value of a symbol that names a special form.

   Operations on a symbol's value cell and function cell are sometimes
described in terms of their effect on the symbol itself, but the user
should keep in mind that there is an intimate relationship between the
contents of those cells and the global variable or global function
definition, respectively.

   Symbols are used as identifiers for lexical variables and lexical
function definitions, but in that role, only their object identity is
significant.  Common Lisp provides no operation on a symbol that can
have any effect on a lexical variable or on a lexical function
definition.

10.2.2 keyword [Type]
---------------------

Supertypes::
............

keyword, symbol, t

Description::
.............

The type keyword includes all symbols interned the KEYWORD package.

   Interning a symbol in the KEYWORD package has three automatic
effects:

1.
     It causes the symbol to become bound to itself.
2.
     It causes the symbol to become an external symbol of the KEYWORD
     package.
3.
     It causes the symbol to become a constant variable.

-----------------------------

‘make-symbol’ name ⇒ new-symbol

Arguments and Values::
......................

name--a string.

   new-symbol--a fresh, uninterned symbol.

Description::
.............

make-symbol creates and returns a fresh, uninterned symbol whose name is
the given name.  The new-symbol is neither bound nor fbound and has a
null property list.

   It is implementation-dependent whether the string that becomes the
new-symbol's name is the given name or a copy of it.  Once a string has
been given as the name argument to make-symbol, the consequences are
undefined if a subsequent attempt is made to alter that string.

Examples::
..........

      (setq temp-string "temp") ⇒  "temp"
      (setq temp-symbol (make-symbol temp-string)) ⇒  #:|temp|
      (symbol-name temp-symbol) ⇒  "temp"

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if name is not a string.

See Also::
..........

*note copy-symbol::

Notes::
.......

No attempt is made by make-symbol to convert the case of the name to
uppercase.  The only case conversion which ever occurs for symbols is
done by the Lisp reader.  The program interface to symbol creation
retains case, and the program interface to interning symbols is
case-sensitive.

10.2.6 copy-symbol [Function]
-----------------------------

‘copy-symbol’ symbol &optional copy-properties ⇒ new-symbol

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbol--a symbol.

   copy-properties--a generalized boolean.  The default is false.

   new-symbol--a fresh, uninterned symbol.

Description::
.............

copy-symbol returns a fresh, uninterned symbol, the name of which is
string= to and possibly the same as the name of the given symbol.

   If copy-properties is false, the new-symbol is neither bound nor
fbound and has a null property list.  If copy-properties is true, then
the initial value of new-symbol is the value of symbol, the initial
function definition of new-symbol is the functional value of symbol, and
the property list of new-symbol is

   a copy_2 of the property list of symbol.

Examples::
..........

      (setq fred 'fred-smith) ⇒  FRED-SMITH
      (setf (symbol-value fred) 3) ⇒  3
      (setq fred-clone-1a (copy-symbol fred nil)) ⇒  #:FRED-SMITH

      (fboundp fred) ⇒  true
      (fboundp fred-clone-1a) ⇒  false
      (fboundp fred-clone-2a) ⇒  false

Exceptional Situations::
........................

See Also::
..........

*note make-symbol::

Notes::
.......

Implementors are encouraged not to copy the string which is the symbol's
name unnecessarily.  Unless there is a good reason to do so, the normal
implementation strategy is for the new-symbol's name to be identical to
the given symbol's name.

10.2.7 gensym [Function]
------------------------

‘gensym’ &optional x ⇒ new-symbol

Arguments and Values::
......................

x--a string or a non-negative integer.  Complicated defaulting behavior;
see below.

   new-symbol--a fresh, uninterned symbol.

Description::
.............

Creates and returns a fresh, uninterned symbol, as if by calling
make-symbol.  (The only difference between gensym and make-symbol is in
how the new-symbol's name is determined.)

   The name of the new-symbol is the concatenation of a prefix, which
defaults to "G", and

   a suffix, which is the decimal representation of a number that
defaults to the value of *gensym-counter*.

   If x is supplied, and is a string, then that string is used as a
prefix instead of "G" for this call to gensym only.

   If x is supplied, and is an integer, then that integer, instead of
the value of *gensym-counter*, is used as the suffix for this call to
gensym only.

   If and only if no explicit suffix is supplied, *gensym-counter* is
incremented after it is used.

Examples::
..........

      (setq sym1 (gensym)) ⇒  #:G3142
      (symbol-package sym1) ⇒  NIL
      (setq sym2 (gensym 100)) ⇒  #:G100
      (setq sym3 (gensym 100)) ⇒  #:G100
      (eq sym2 sym3) ⇒  false
      (find-symbol "G100") ⇒  NIL, NIL
      (gensym "T") ⇒  #:T3143
      (gensym) ⇒  #:G3144

Side Effects::
..............

Might increment *gensym-counter*.

Notes::
.......

The ability to pass a numeric argument to gensym has been deprecated;
explicitly binding *gensym-counter* is now stylistically preferred.
(The somewhat baroque conventions for the optional argument are
historical in nature, and supported primarily for compatibility with
older dialects of Lisp.  In modern code, it is recommended that the only
kind of argument used be a string prefix.  In general, though, to obtain
more flexible control of the new-symbol's name, consider using
make-symbol instead.)

10.2.9 gentemp [Function]
-------------------------

‘gentemp’ &optional prefix package ⇒ new-symbol

Arguments and Values::
......................

prefix--a string.  The default is "T".

   package--a package designator.  The default is the current package.

   new-symbol--a fresh, interned symbol.

Description::
.............

gentemp creates and returns a fresh symbol, interned in the indicated
package.  The symbol is guaranteed to be one that was not previously
accessible in package.  It is neither bound nor fbound, and has a null
property list.

   The name of the new-symbol is the concatenation of the prefix and a
suffix, which is taken from an internal counter used only by gentemp.
(If a symbol by that name is already accessible in package, the counter
is incremented as many times as is necessary to produce a name that is
not already the name of a symbol accessible in package.)

Examples::
..........

      (gentemp) ⇒  T1298
      (gentemp "FOO") ⇒  FOO1299
      (find-symbol "FOO1300") ⇒  NIL, NIL
      (gentemp "FOO") ⇒  FOO1300
      (find-symbol "FOO1300") ⇒  FOO1300, :INTERNAL
      (intern "FOO1301") ⇒  FOO1301, :INTERNAL
      (gentemp "FOO") ⇒  FOO1302
      (gentemp) ⇒  T1303

Side Effects::
..............

Its internal counter is incremented one or more times.

   Interns the new-symbol in package.

Affected By::
.............

The current state of its internal counter, and the current state of the
package.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if prefix is not a string.
Should signal an error of type type-error if package is not a package
designator.

See Also::
..........

*note gensym::

Notes::
.......

The function gentemp is deprecated.

   If package is the KEYWORD package, the result is an external symbol
of package.  Otherwise, the result is an internal symbol of package.

   The gentemp internal counter is independent of *gensym-counter*, the
counter used by gensym.  There is no provision for accessing the gentemp
internal counter.

   Just because gentemp creates a symbol which did not previously exist
does not mean that such a symbol might not be seen in the future (e.g.,
in a data file--perhaps even created by the same program in another
session).  As such, this symbol is not truly unique in the same sense as
a gensym would be.  In particular, programs which do automatic code
generation should be careful not to attach global attributes to such
generated symbols (e.g., special declarations) and then write them into
a file because such global attributes might, in a different session, end
up applying to other symbols that were automatically generated on
another day for some other purpose.

10.2.15 get [Accessor]
----------------------

‘get’ symbol indicator &optional default ⇒ value

   (setf (‘ get’ symbol indicator &optional default) new-value)

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbol--a symbol.

   indicator--an object.

   default--an object.  The default is nil.

   value--if the indicated property exists, the object that is its
value; otherwise, the specified default.

   new-value--an object.

Description::
.............

get finds a property on the property list_2 of symbol whose property
indicator is identical to indicator, and returns its corresponding
property value.

   If there are multiple properties_1 with that property indicator, get
uses the first such property.

   If there is no property with that property indicator, default is
returned.

   setf of get may be used to associate a new object with an existing
indicator already on the symbol's property list, or to create a new
association if none exists.

   If there are multiple properties_1 with that property indicator, setf
of get associates the new-value with the first such property.

   When a get form is used as a setf place, any default which is
supplied is evaluated according to normal left-to-right evaluation
rules, but its value is ignored.

Examples::
..........

      (defun make-person (first-name last-name)
        (let ((person (gensym "PERSON")))
          (setf (get person 'first-name) first-name)
          (setf (get person 'last-name) last-name)
          person)) ⇒  MAKE-PERSON
      (defvar *john* (make-person "John" "Dow")) ⇒  *JOHN*
      *john* ⇒  #:PERSON4603
      (defvar *sally* (make-person "Sally" "Jones")) ⇒  *SALLY*
      (get *john* 'first-name) ⇒  "John"
      (get *sally* 'last-name) ⇒  "Jones"
      (defun marry (man woman married-name)
        (setf (get man 'wife) woman)
        (setf (get woman 'husband) man)
        (setf (get man 'last-name) married-name)
        (setf (get woman 'last-name) married-name)
        married-name) ⇒  MARRY
      (marry *john* *sally* "Dow-Jones") ⇒  "Dow-Jones"
      (get *john* 'last-name) ⇒  "Dow-Jones"
      (get (get *john* 'wife) 'first-name) ⇒  "Sally"
      (symbol-plist *john*)
     ⇒  (WIFE #:PERSON4604 LAST-NAME "Dow-Jones" FIRST-NAME "John")
      (defmacro age (person &optional (default ''thirty-something))
        `(get ,person 'age ,default)) ⇒  AGE
      (age *john*) ⇒  THIRTY-SOMETHING
      (age *john* 20) ⇒  20
      (setf (age *john*) 25) ⇒  25
      (age *john*) ⇒  25
      (age *john* 20) ⇒  25

10.2.16 remprop [Function]
--------------------------

‘remprop’ symbol indicator ⇒ generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbol--a symbol.

   indicator--an object.

   generalized-boolean--a generalized boolean.

Description::
.............

remprop removes from the property list_2 of symbol a property_1 with a
property indicator identical to indicator.

   If there are multiple properties_1 with the identical key, remprop
only removes the first such property.

   remprop returns false if no such property was found, or true if a
property was found.

   The property indicator and the corresponding property value are
removed in an undefined order by destructively splicing the property
list.

   The permissible side-effects correspond to those permitted for remf,
such that:

      (remprop x y) ≡ (remf (symbol-plist x) y)

Examples::
..........

      (setq test (make-symbol "PSEUDO-PI")) ⇒  #:PSEUDO-PI
      (symbol-plist test) ⇒  ()
      (setf (get test 'constant) t) ⇒  T
      (setf (get test 'approximation) 3.14) ⇒  3.14
      (setf (get test 'error-range) 'noticeable) ⇒  NOTICEABLE
      (symbol-plist test)
     ⇒  (ERROR-RANGE NOTICEABLE APPROXIMATION 3.14 CONSTANT T)
      (setf (get test 'approximation) nil) ⇒  NIL
      (symbol-plist test)
     ⇒  (ERROR-RANGE NOTICEABLE APPROXIMATION NIL CONSTANT T)
      (get test 'approximation) ⇒  NIL
      (remprop test 'approximation) ⇒  true
      (get test 'approximation) ⇒  NIL
      (symbol-plist test)
     ⇒  (ERROR-RANGE NOTICEABLE CONSTANT T)
      (remprop test 'approximation) ⇒  NIL
      (symbol-plist test)
     ⇒  (ERROR-RANGE NOTICEABLE CONSTANT T)
      (remprop test 'error-range) ⇒  true
      (setf (get test 'approximation) 3) ⇒  3
      (symbol-plist test)
     ⇒  (APPROXIMATION 3 CONSTANT T)

Side Effects::
..............

The property list of symbol is modified.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if symbol is not a symbol.

See Also::
..........

*note remf:: , *note symbol-plist::

Notes::
.......

Numbers and characters are not recommended for use as indicators in
portable code since remprop tests with eq rather than eql, and
consequently the effect of using such indicators is
implementation-dependent.  Of course, if you've gotten as far as needing
to remove such a property, you don't have much choice--the time to have
been thinking about this was when you used setf of get to establish the
property.

11.1.1 Introduction to Packages
-------------------------------

A package establishes a mapping from names to symbols.  At any given
time, one package is current.  The current package is the one that is
the value of *package*.  When using the Lisp reader, it is possible to
refer to symbols in packages other than the current one through the use
of package prefixes in the printed representation of the symbol.

   Figure 11-1 lists some defined names that are applicable to packages.
Where an operator takes an argument that is either a symbol or a list of
symbols, an argument of nil is treated as an empty list of symbols.  Any
package argument may be either a string, a symbol, or a package.  If a
symbol is supplied, its name will be used as the package name.

11.1.1.1 Package Names and Nicknames
....................................

Each package has a name (a string) and perhaps some nicknames (also
strings).  These are assigned when the package is created and can be
changed later.

   There is a single namespace for packages.  The function find-package
translates a package name or nickname into the associated package.  The
function package-name returns the name of a package.  The function
package-nicknames returns a list of all nicknames for a package.
rename-package removes a package's current name and nicknames and
replaces them with new ones specified by the caller.

File: gcl.info,  Node: Internal and External Symbols,  Next: Package Inheritance,  Prev: Symbols in a Package,  Up: Introduction to Packages

11.1.1.3 Internal and External Symbols
......................................

The mappings in a package are divided into two classes, external and
internal.  The symbols targeted by these different mappings are called
external symbols and internal symbols of the package.  Within a package,
a name refers to one symbol or to none; if it does refer to a symbol,
then it is either external or internal in that package, but not both.
External symbols

   are part of the package's public interface to other packages.
Symbols become external symbols of a given package if they have been
exported from that package.

   A symbol has the same name no matter what package it is present in,
but it might be an external symbol of some packages and an internal
symbol of others.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Package Inheritance,  Next: Accessibility of Symbols in a Package,  Prev: Internal and External Symbols,  Up: Introduction to Packages

11.1.1.4 Package Inheritance
............................

Packages can be built up in layers.  From one point of view, a package
is a single collection of mappings from strings into internal symbols
and external symbols.  However, some of these mappings might be
established within the package itself, while other mappings are
inherited from other packages via use-package.  A symbol is said to be
present in a package if the mapping is in the package itself and is not
inherited from somewhere else.

   There is no way to inherit the internal symbols of another package;
to refer to an internal symbol using the Lisp reader, a package
containing the symbol must be made to be the current package, a package
prefix must be used, or the symbol must be imported into the current
package.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Accessibility of Symbols in a Package,  Next: Locating a Symbol in a Package,  Prev: Package Inheritance,  Up: Introduction to Packages

11.1.1.5 Accessibility of Symbols in a Package
..............................................

A symbol becomes accessible in a package if that is its home package
when it is created, or if it is imported into that package, or by
inheritance via use-package.

   If a symbol is accessible in a package, it can be referred to when
using the Lisp reader without a package prefix when that package is the
current package, regardless of whether it is present or inherited.

   Symbols from one package can be made accessible in another package in
two ways.

-
     Any individual symbol can be added to a package by use of import.
     After the call to import the symbol is present in the importing
     package.  The status of the symbol in the package it came from (if
     any) is unchanged, and the home package for this symbol is
     unchanged.  Once imported, a symbol is present in the importing
     package and can be removed only by calling unintern.

     A symbol is shadowed_3 by another symbol in some package if the
     first symbol would be accessible by inheritance if not for the
     presence of the second symbol.  See shadowing-import.

-
     The second mechanism for making symbols from one package accessible
     in another is provided by use-package.  All of the external symbols
     of the used package are inherited by the using package.  The
     function unuse-package undoes the effects of a previous
     use-package.

11.1.1.6 Locating a Symbol in a Package
.......................................

When a symbol is to be located in a given package the following occurs:

-
     The external symbols and internal symbols of the package are
     searched for the symbol.
-
     The external symbols of the used packages are searched in some
     unspecified order.  The order does not matter; see the rules for
     handling name conflicts listed below.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Prevention of Name Conflicts in Packages,  Prev: Locating a Symbol in a Package,  Up: Introduction to Packages

11.1.1.7 Prevention of Name Conflicts in Packages
.................................................

Within one package, any particular name can refer to at most one symbol.
A name conflict is said to occur when there would be more than one
candidate symbol.  Any time a name conflict is about to occur, a
correctable error is signaled.

   The following rules apply to name conflicts:

-
     Name conflicts are detected when they become possible, that is,
     when the package structure is altered.  Name conflicts are not
     checked during every name lookup.

-
     If the same symbol is accessible to a package through more than one
     path, there is no name conflict.  A symbol cannot conflict with
     itself.  Name conflicts occur only between distinct symbols with
     the same name (under string=).

-
     Every package has a list of shadowing symbols.  A shadowing symbol
     takes precedence over any other symbol of the same name that would
     otherwise be accessible in the package.  A name conflict involving
     a shadowing symbol is always resolved in favor of the shadowing
     symbol, without signaling an error (except for one exception
     involving import).  See shadow and shadowing-import.

-
     The functions use-package, import, and export check for name
     conflicts.

-
     shadow and shadowing-import never signal a name-conflict error.

-
     unuse-package and unexport do not need to do any name-conflict
     checking.  unintern does name-conflict checking only when a symbol
     being uninterned is a shadowing symbol .

-
     Giving a shadowing symbol to unintern can uncover a name conflict
     that had previously been resolved by the shadowing.

-
     Package functions signal name-conflict errors of type package-error
     before making any change to the package structure.  When multiple
     changes are to be made, it is permissible for the implementation to
     process each change separately.  For example, when export is given
     a list of symbols, aborting from a name conflict caused by the
     second symbol in the list might still export the first symbol in
     the list.  However, a name-conflict error caused by export of a
     single symbol will be signaled before that symbol's accessibility
     in any package is changed.

-
     Continuing from a name-conflict error must offer the user a chance
     to resolve the name conflict in favor of either of the candidates.
     The package structure should be altered to reflect the resolution
     of the name conflict, via shadowing-import, unintern, or unexport.

-
     A name conflict in use-package between a symbol present in the
     using package and an external symbol of the used package is
     resolved in favor of the first symbol by making it a shadowing
     symbol, or in favor of the second symbol by uninterning the first
     symbol from the using package.

-
     A name conflict in export or unintern due to a package's inheriting
     two distinct symbols with the same name (under string=) from two
     other packages can be resolved in favor of either symbol by
     importing it into the using package and making it a shadowing
     symbol , just as with use-package.

11.1.2.1 The COMMON-LISP Package
................................

The COMMON-LISP package contains the primitives of the Common Lisp
system as defined by this specification.  Its external symbols include
all of the defined names (except for defined names in the KEYWORD
package) that are present in the Common Lisp system, such as car, cdr,
*package*, etc.  The COMMON-LISP package has the nickname CL.

   The COMMON-LISP package has as external symbols those symbols
enumerated in the figures in *note Symbols in the COMMON-LISP Package::,
and no others.  These external symbols are present in the COMMON-LISP
package but their home package need not be the COMMON-LISP package.

   For example, the symbol HELP cannot be an external symbol of the
COMMON-LISP package because it is not mentioned in *note Symbols in the
COMMON-LISP Package::.  In contrast, the symbol variable must be an
external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package even though it has no
definition because it is listed in that section (to support its use as a
valid second argument to the function documentation).

   The COMMON-LISP package can have additional internal symbols.

11.1.2.2 Constraints on the COMMON-LISP Package for Conforming Implementations
..............................................................................

In a conforming implementation, an external symbol of the COMMON-LISP
package can have a function, macro, or special operator definition, a
global variable definition (or other status as a dynamic variable due to
a special proclamation), or a type definition only if explicitly
permitted in this standard.  For example, fboundp yields false for any
external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package that is not the name of a
standardized function, macro or special operator, and boundp returns
false for any external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package that is not the
name of a standardized global variable.  It also follows that conforming
programs can use external symbols of the COMMON-LISP package as the
names of local lexical variables with confidence that those names have
not been proclaimed special by the implementation unless those symbols
are names of standardized global variables.

   A conforming implementation must not place any property on an
external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package using a property indicator
that is either an external symbol of any standardized package or a
symbol that is otherwise accessible in the COMMON-LISP-USER package.

11.1.2.3 Constraints on the COMMON-LISP Package for Conforming Programs
.......................................................................

Except where explicitly allowed, the consequences are undefined if any
of the following actions are performed on an external symbol of the
COMMON-LISP package:

1.
     Binding or altering its value (lexically or dynamically).  (Some
     exceptions are noted below.)

2.
     Defining,

     undefining,

     or binding it as a function.  (Some exceptions are noted below.)

3.
     Defining,

     undefining,

     or binding it as a macro

     or compiler macro.

     (Some exceptions are noted below.)

4.

     define-condition).

5.
     Defining it as a structure (via defstruct).

6.
     Defining it as a declaration with a declaration proclamation.

7.
     Defining it as a symbol macro.

8.
     Altering its home package.

11.1.2.4 Some Exceptions to Constraints on the COMMON-LISP Package for Conforming Programs
..........................................................................................

If an external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package is not globally defined
as a standardized dynamic variable or constant variable, it is allowed
to lexically bind it and to declare the type of that binding, and it is
allowed to locally establish it as a symbol macro (e.g., with
symbol-macrolet).

   Unless explicitly specified otherwise, if an external symbol of the
COMMON-LISP package is globally defined as a standardized dynamic
variable, it is permitted to bind or assign that dynamic variable
provided that the "Value Type" constraints on the dynamic variable are
maintained, and that the new value of the variable is consistent with
the stated purpose of the variable.

   If an external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package is not defined as a
standardized function, macro, or special operator, it is allowed to
lexically bind it as a function (e.g., with flet), to declare the ftype
of that binding, and (in implementations which provide the ability to do
so) to trace that binding.

   If an external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package is not defined as a
standardized function, macro, or special operator, it is allowed to
lexically bind it as a macro (e.g., with macrolet).

   If an external symbol of the COMMON-LISP package is not defined as a
standardized function, macro, or special operator, it is allowed to
lexically bind its setf function name as a function, and to declare the
ftype of that binding.

11.1.2.5 The COMMON-LISP-USER Package
.....................................

The COMMON-LISP-USER package is the current package when a Common Lisp
system starts up.  This package uses the COMMON-LISP package.  The
COMMON-LISP-USER package has the nickname CL-USER.

   The COMMON-LISP-USER package can have additional symbols interned
within it; it can use other implementation-defined packages.

11.1.2.6 The KEYWORD Package
............................

The KEYWORD package contains symbols, called keywords_1, that are
typically used as special markers in programs and their associated data
expressions_1.

   Symbol tokens that start with a package marker are parsed by the Lisp
reader as symbols in the KEYWORD package; see *note Symbols as Tokens::.
This makes it notationally convenient to use keywords when communicating
between programs in different packages.  For example, the mechanism for
passing keyword parameters in a call uses keywords_1 to name the
corresponding arguments; see *note Ordinary Lambda Lists::.

   Symbols in the KEYWORD package are, by definition, of type keyword.

11.1.2.7 Interning a Symbol in the KEYWORD Package
..................................................

The KEYWORD package is treated differently than other packages in that
special actions are taken when a symbol is interned in it.  In
particular, when a symbol is interned in the KEYWORD package, it is
automatically made to be an external symbol and is automatically made to
be a constant variable with itself as a value.

11.1.2.8 Notes about The KEYWORD Package
........................................

It is generally best to confine the use of keywords to situations in
which there are a finitely enumerable set of names to be selected
between.  For example, if there were two states of a light switch, they
might be called :on and :off.

   In situations where the set of names is not finitely enumerable
(i.e., where name conflicts might arise) it is frequently best to use
symbols in some package other than KEYWORD so that conflicts will be
naturally avoided.  For example, it is generally not wise for a program
to use a keyword_1 as a property indicator, since if there were ever
another program that did the same thing, each would clobber the other's
data.

11.1.2.9 Implementation-Defined Packages
........................................

Other, implementation-defined packages might be present in the initial
Common Lisp environment.

   It is recommended, but not required, that the documentation for a
conforming implementation contain a full list of all package names
initially present in that implementation but not specified in this
specification.  (See also the function list-all-packages.)

11.2.2 export [Function]
------------------------

‘export’ symbols &optional package ⇒ t

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbols--a designator for a list of symbols.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

export makes one or more symbols that are accessible in package (whether
directly or by inheritance) be external symbols of that package.

   If any of the symbols is already accessible as an external symbol of
package, export has no effect on that symbol.  If the symbol is present
in package as an internal symbol, it is simply changed to external
status.  If it is accessible as an internal symbol via use-package, it
is first imported into package, then exported.  (The symbol is then
present in the package whether or not package continues to use the
package through which the symbol was originally inherited.)

   export makes each symbol accessible to all the packages that use
package.  All of these packages are checked for name conflicts: (export
s p) does (find-symbol (symbol-name s) q) for each package q in
(package-used-by-list p).  Note that in the usual case of an export
during the initial definition of a package, the result of
package-used-by-list is nil and the name-conflict checking takes
negligible time.  When multiple changes are to be made, for example when
export is given a list of symbols, it is permissible for the
implementation to process each change separately, so that aborting from
a name conflict caused by any but the first symbol in the list does not
unexport the first symbol in the list.  However, aborting from a
name-conflict error caused by export of one of symbols does not leave
that symbol accessible to some packages and inaccessible to others; with
respect to each of symbols processed, export behaves as if it were as an
atomic operation.

   A name conflict in export between one of symbols being exported and a
symbol already present in a package that would inherit the
newly-exported symbol may be resolved in favor of the exported symbol by
uninterning the other one, or in favor of the already-present symbol by
making it a shadowing symbol.

Examples::
..........

      (make-package 'temp :use nil) ⇒  #<PACKAGE "TEMP">
      (use-package 'temp) ⇒  T
      (intern "TEMP-SYM" 'temp) ⇒  TEMP::TEMP-SYM, NIL
      (find-symbol "TEMP-SYM") ⇒  NIL, NIL
      (export (find-symbol "TEMP-SYM" 'temp) 'temp) ⇒  T
      (find-symbol "TEMP-SYM") ⇒  TEMP-SYM, :INHERITED

Side Effects::
..............

The package system is modified.

Affected By::
.............

Accessible symbols.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

If any of the symbols is not accessible at all in package, an error of
type package-error is signaled that is correctable by permitting the
user to interactively specify whether that symbol should be imported.

11.2.3 find-symbol [Function]
-----------------------------

‘find-symbol’ string &optional package ⇒ symbol, status

Arguments and Values::
......................

string--a string.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

   symbol--a symbol accessible in the package, or nil.

   status--one of :inherited, :external, :internal, or nil.

Description::
.............

find-symbol locates a symbol whose name is string in a package.  If a
symbol named string is found in package, directly or by inheritance, the
symbol found is returned as the first value; the second value is as
follows:

:internal
     If the symbol is present in package as an internal symbol.

:external
     If the symbol is present in package as an external symbol.

:inherited
     If the symbol is inherited by package through use-package, but is
     not present in package.

   If no such symbol is accessible in package, both values are nil.

Description::
.............

If name is a string designator, find-package locates and returns the
package whose name or nickname is name.  This search is case sensitive.
If there is no such package, find-package returns nil.

11.2.6 import [Function]
------------------------

‘import’ symbols &optional package ⇒ t

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbols--a designator for a list of symbols.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

import adds symbol or symbols to the internals of package, checking for
name conflicts with existing symbols either present in package or
accessible to it.  Once the symbols have been imported, they may be
referenced in the importing package without the use of a package prefix
when using the Lisp reader.

   A name conflict in import between the symbol being imported and a
symbol inherited from some other package can be resolved in favor of the
symbol being imported by making it a shadowing symbol, or in favor of
the symbol already accessible by not doing the import.  A name conflict
in import with a symbol already present in the package may be resolved
by uninterning that symbol, or by not doing the import.

   The imported symbol is not automatically exported from the current
package, but if it is already present and external, then the fact that
it is external is not changed.

   If any symbol to be imported has no home package (i.e.,
(symbol-package symbol) ⇒ nil), import sets the home package of the
symbol to package.

   If the symbol is already present in the importing package, import has
no effect.

Examples::
..........

      (import 'common-lisp::car (make-package 'temp :use nil)) ⇒  T
      (find-symbol "CAR" 'temp) ⇒  CAR, :INTERNAL
      (find-symbol "CDR" 'temp) ⇒  NIL, NIL

   The form (import 'editor:buffer) takes the external symbol named
buffer in the EDITOR package (this symbol was located when the form was
read by the Lisp reader) and adds it to the current package as an
internal symbol.  The symbol buffer is then present in the current
package.

Side Effects::
..............

The package system is modified.

Affected By::
.............

Current state of the package system.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

import signals a correctable error of type package-error if any of the
symbols to be imported has the same name (under string=) as some
distinct symbol (under eql) already accessible in the package, even if
the conflict is with a shadowing symbol of the package.

‘shadow’ symbol-names &optional package ⇒ t

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbol-names--a designator for a list of string designators.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

shadow assures that symbols with names given by symbol-names are present
in the package.

   Specifically, package is searched for symbols with the names supplied
by symbol-names.

   For each such name, if a corresponding symbol is not present in
package (directly, not by inheritance), then a corresponding symbol is
created with that name, and inserted into package as an internal symbol.
The corresponding symbol, whether pre-existing or newly created, is then
added, if not already present, to the shadowing symbols list of package.

Examples::
..........

      (package-shadowing-symbols (make-package 'temp)) ⇒  NIL
      (find-symbol 'car 'temp) ⇒  CAR, :INHERITED
      (shadow 'car 'temp) ⇒  T

11.2.10 shadowing-import [Function]
-----------------------------------

‘shadowing-import’ symbols &optional package ⇒ t

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbols--a designator for a list of symbols.

   package --a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

shadowing-import is like import, but it does not signal an error even if
the importation of a symbol would shadow some symbol already accessible
in package.

   shadowing-import inserts each of symbols into package as an internal
symbol, regardless of whether another symbol of the same name is
shadowed by this action.  If a different symbol of the same name is
already present in package, that symbol is first uninterned from
package.  The new symbol is added to package's shadowing-symbols list.

   shadowing-import does name-conflict checking to the extent that it
checks whether a distinct existing symbol with the same name is
accessible; if so, it is shadowed by the new symbol, which implies that
it must be uninterned if it was present in package.

Examples::
..........

      (in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER") ⇒  #<PACKAGE "COMMON-LISP-USER">
      (setq sym (intern "CONFLICT")) ⇒  CONFLICT
      (intern "CONFLICT" (make-package 'temp)) ⇒  TEMP::CONFLICT, NIL

11.2.11 delete-package [Function]
---------------------------------

‘delete-package’ package ⇒ generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values::
......................

package--a package designator.

   generalized-boolean--a generalized boolean.

Description::
.............

delete-package deletes package from all package system data structures.
If the operation is successful, delete-package returns true, otherwise
nil.  The effect of delete-package is that the name and nicknames of
package cease to be recognized package names.  The package object is
still a package (i.e., packagep is true of it) but package-name returns
nil.  The consequences of deleting the COMMON-LISP package or the
KEYWORD package are undefined.  The consequences of invoking any other
package operation on package once it has been deleted are unspecified.
In particular, the consequences of invoking find-symbol, intern and
other functions that look for a symbol name in a package are unspecified
if they are called with *package* bound to the deleted package or with
the deleted package as an argument.

   If package is a package object that has already been deleted,
delete-package immediately returns nil.

   After this operation completes, the home package of any symbol whose
home package had previously been package is implementation-dependent.
Except for this, symbols accessible in package are not modified in any
other way; symbols whose home package is not package remain unchanged.

Examples::
..........

      (setq *foo-package* (make-package "FOO" :use nil))
      (setq *foo-symbol*  (intern "FOO" *foo-package*))

Exceptional Situations::
........................

If the package designator is a name that does not currently name a
package, a correctable error of type package-error is signaled.  If
correction is attempted, no deletion action is attempted; instead,
delete-package immediately returns nil.

   If package is used by other packages, a correctable error of type
package-error is signaled.  If correction is attempted, unuse-package is
effectively called to remove any dependencies, causing package's
external symbols to cease being accessible to those packages that use
package.  delete-package then deletes package just as it would have had
there been no packages that used it.

11.2.12 make-package [Function]
-------------------------------

‘make-package’ package-name &key nicknames use ⇒ package

Arguments and Values::
......................

package-name--a string designator.

   nicknames--a list of string designators.  The default is the empty
list.

   use-- a list of package designators.

   The default is implementation-defined.

   package--a package.

Description::
.............

Creates a new package with the name package-name.

   Nicknames are additional names which may be used to refer to the new
package.

   use specifies zero or more packages the external symbols of which are
to be inherited by the new package.  See the function use-package.

Examples::
..........

      (make-package 'temporary :nicknames '("TEMP" "temp")) ⇒  #<PACKAGE "TEMPORARY">
      (make-package "OWNER" :use '("temp")) ⇒  #<PACKAGE "OWNER">
      (package-used-by-list 'temp) ⇒  (#<PACKAGE "OWNER">)
      (package-use-list 'owner) ⇒  (#<PACKAGE "TEMPORARY">)

Affected By::
.............

The existence of other packages in the system.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

The consequences are unspecified if packages denoted by use do not
exist.

   A correctable error is signaled if the package-name or any of the
nicknames is already the name or nickname of an existing package.

See Also::
..........

*note defpackage:: , *note use-package::

Notes::
.......

In situations where the packages to be used contain symbols which would
conflict, it is necessary to first create the package with :use '(),
then to use shadow or shadowing-import to address the conflicts, and
then after that to use use-package once the conflicts have been
addressed.

   When packages are being created as part of the static definition of a
program rather than dynamically by the program, it is generally
considered more stylistically appropriate to use defpackage rather than
make-package.

11.2.13 with-package-iterator [Macro]
-------------------------------------

‘with-package-iterator’ (name package-list-form &rest symbol-types)
{declaration}* {form}*
⇒ {result}*

Arguments and Values::
......................

name--a symbol.

   package-list-form--a form; evaluated once to produce a package-list.

   package-list--a designator for a list of package designators.

   symbol-type--one of the symbols :internal, :external, or :inherited.

   declaration--a declare expression; not evaluated.

   forms--an implicit progn.

   results--the values of the forms.

Description::
.............

Within the lexical scope of the body forms, the name is defined via
macrolet such that successive invocations of (name) will return the
symbols, one by one, from the packages in package-list.

   It is unspecified whether symbols inherited from multiple packages
are returned more than once.  The order of symbols returned does not
necessarily reflect the order of packages in package-list.  When
package-list has more than one element, it is unspecified whether
duplicate symbols are returned once or more than once.

   Symbol-types controls which symbols that are accessible in a package
are returned as follows:

:internal
     The symbols that are present in the package, but that are not
     exported.

:external
     The symbols that are present in the package and are exported.

:inherited
     The symbols that are exported by used packages and that are not
     shadowed.

   When more than one argument is supplied for symbol-types, a symbol is
returned if its accessibility matches any one of the symbol-types
supplied.  Implementations may extend this syntax by recognizing
additional symbol accessibility types.

   An invocation of (name) returns four values as follows:

1.
     A flag that indicates whether a symbol is returned (true means that
     a symbol is returned).
2.
     A symbol that is accessible in one the indicated packages.
3.
     The accessibility type for that symbol; i.e., one of the symbols
     :internal, :external, or :inherited.
4.
     The package from which the symbol was obtained.  The package is one
     of the packages present or named in package-list.

   After all symbols have been returned by successive invocations of
(name), then only one value is returned, namely nil.

   The meaning of the second, third, and fourth values is that the
returned symbol is accessible in the returned package in the way
indicated by the second return value as follows:

:internal
     Means present and not exported.

:external
     Means present and exported.

:inherited
     Means not present (thus not shadowed) but inherited from some used
     package.

   It is unspecified what happens if any of the implicit interior state
of an iteration is returned outside the dynamic extent of the
with-package-iterator form such as by returning some closure over the
invocation form.

   Any number of invocations of with-package-iterator can be nested, and
the body of the innermost one can invoke all of the locally established
macros, provided all those macros have distinct names.

Examples::
..........

The following function should return t on any package, and signal an
error if the usage of with-package-iterator does not agree with the
corresponding usage of do-symbols.

      (defun test-package-iterator (package)
        (unless (packagep package)
          (setq package (find-package package)))
        (let ((all-entries '())
              (generated-entries '()))
          (do-symbols (x package)
            (multiple-value-bind (symbol accessibility)
                (find-symbol (symbol-name x) package)
              (push (list symbol accessibility) all-entries)))
          (with-package-iterator (generator-fn package
                                  :internal :external :inherited)
            (loop
              (multiple-value-bind (more? symbol accessibility pkg)
                  (generator-fn)
                (unless more? (return))
                (let ((l (multiple-value-list (find-symbol (symbol-name symbol)
                                                           package))))
                  (unless (equal l (list symbol accessibility))
                    (error "Symbol ~S not found as ~S in package ~A [~S]"
                           symbol accessibility (package-name package) l))
                  (push l generated-entries)))))
          (unless (and (subsetp all-entries generated-entries :test #'equal)
                       (subsetp generated-entries all-entries :test #'equal))
           (error "Generated entries and Do-Symbols entries don't correspond"))
          t))

   The following function prints out every present symbol (possibly more
than once):

      (defun print-all-symbols ()
        (with-package-iterator (next-symbol (list-all-packages)
                                :internal :external)
          (loop
            (multiple-value-bind (more? symbol) (next-symbol)
              (if more?
                 (print symbol)
                 (return))))))

Exceptional Situations::
........................

with-package-iterator signals an error of type program-error if no
symbol-types are supplied or if a symbol-type is not recognized by the
implementation is supplied.

   The consequences are undefined if the local function named name
established by with-package-iterator is called after it has returned
false as its primary value.

11.2.14 unexport [Function]
---------------------------

‘unexport’ symbols &optional package ⇒ t

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbols--a designator for a list of symbols.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

unexport reverts external symbols in package to internal status; it
undoes the effect of export.

   unexport works only on symbols present in package, switching them
back to internal status.  If unexport is given a symbol that is already
accessible as an internal symbol in package, it does nothing.

Examples::
..........

      (in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER") ⇒  #<PACKAGE "COMMON-LISP-USER">
      (export (intern "CONTRABAND" (make-package 'temp)) 'temp) ⇒  T

Affected By::

11.2.15 unintern [Function]
---------------------------

‘unintern’ symbol &optional package ⇒ generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values::
......................

symbol--a symbol.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

   generalized-boolean--a generalized boolean.

Description::
.............

unintern removes symbol from package.  If symbol is present in package,
it is removed from package and also from package's shadowing symbols
list if it is present there.  If package is the home package for symbol,
symbol is made to have no home package.  Symbol may continue to be
accessible in package by inheritance.

   Use of unintern can result in a symbol that has no recorded home
package, but that in fact is accessible in some package.  Common Lisp
does not check for this pathological case, and such symbols are always
printed preceded by #:.

   unintern returns true if it removes symbol, and nil otherwise.

Examples::
..........

      (in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER") ⇒  #<PACKAGE "COMMON-LISP-USER">
      (setq temps-unpack (intern "UNPACK" (make-package 'temp))) ⇒  TEMP::UNPACK
      (unintern temps-unpack 'temp) ⇒  T
      (find-symbol "UNPACK" 'temp) ⇒  NIL, NIL
      temps-unpack ⇒  #:UNPACK

Side Effects::
..............

unintern changes the state of the package system in such a way that the
consistency rules do not hold across the change.

Affected By::
.............

Current state of the package system.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Giving a shadowing symbol to unintern can uncover a name conflict that
had previously been resolved by the shadowing.  If package A uses
packages B and C, A contains a shadowing symbol x, and B and C each
contain external symbols named x, then removing the shadowing symbol x
from A will reveal a name conflict between b:x and c:x if those two
symbols are distinct.  In this case unintern will signal an error.

Description::
.............

Causes the the package named by name to become the current package--that
is, the value of *package*.  If no such package already exists, an error
of type package-error is signaled.

   Everything in-package does is also performed at compile time if the
call appears as a top level form.

Side Effects::
..............

The variable *package* is assigned.  If the in-package form is a top
level form, this assignment also occurs at compile time.

   package--a package designator.  The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

unuse-package causes package to cease inheriting all the external
symbols of packages-to-unuse; unuse-package undoes the effects of
use-package.  The packages-to-unuse are removed from the use list of
package.

   Any symbols that have been imported into package continue to be
present in package.

Examples::

11.2.18 use-package [Function]
------------------------------

‘use-package’ packages-to-use &optional package ⇒ t

Arguments and Values::
......................

packages-to-use--a designator for a list of package designators.  The
KEYWORD package may not be supplied.

   package--a package designator.  The KEYWORD package cannot be
supplied.  The default is the current package.

Description::
.............

use-package causes package to inherit all the external symbols of
packages-to-use.  The inherited symbols become accessible as internal
symbols of package.

   Packages-to-use are added to the use list of package if they are not
there already.  All external symbols in packages-to-use become
accessible in package as internal symbols.  use-package does not cause
any new symbols to be present in package but only makes them accessible
by inheritance.

   use-package checks for name conflicts between the newly imported
symbols and those already accessible in package.  A name conflict in
use-package between two external symbols inherited by package from
packages-to-use may be resolved in favor of either symbol by importing
one of them into package and making it a shadowing symbol.

Examples::
..........

      (export (intern "LAND-FILL" (make-package 'trash)) 'trash) ⇒  T
      (find-symbol "LAND-FILL" (make-package 'temp)) ⇒  NIL, NIL
      (package-use-list 'temp) ⇒  (#<PACKAGE "TEMP">)
      (use-package 'trash 'temp) ⇒  T
      (package-use-list 'temp) ⇒  (#<PACKAGE "TEMP"> #<PACKAGE "TRASH">)

It is permissible for a package P_1 to use a package P_2 even if P_2
already uses P_1.  The using of packages is not transitive, so no
problem results from the apparent circularity.

‘defpackage’ defined-package-name [[!option]] ⇒ package

 {(:use {package-name}*)}* |   {(:shadow {!symbol-name}*)}* | 
 {(:shadowing-import-from package-name {!symbol-name}*)}* | 
 {(:import-from package-name {!symbol-name}*)}* | 
 {(:export {!symbol-name}*)}* |   {(:intern {!symbol-name}*)}* | 
 (:size integer)

   symbol-name ::=(symbol | string)

Arguments and Values::
......................

defined-package-name--a string designator.

   package-name--a package designator.

   nickname--a string designator.

   symbol-name--a string designator.

   package--the package named package-name.

Description::
.............

defpackage creates a package as specified and returns the package.

   If defined-package-name already refers to an existing package, the
name-to-package mapping for that name is not changed.  If the new
definition is at variance with the current state of that package, the
consequences are undefined; an implementation might choose to modify the
existing package to reflect the new definition.  If defined-package-name
is a symbol, its name is used.

   The standard options are described below.

:nicknames
     The arguments to :nicknames set the package's nicknames to the
     supplied names.

:documentation
     The argument to :documentation specifies a documentation string; it
     is attached as a documentation string to the package.  At most one
     :documentation option can appear in a single defpackage form.

:use
     The arguments to :use set the packages that the package named by
     package-name will inherit from.  If :use is not supplied,

     it defaults to the same implementation-dependent value as the :use
     argument to make-package.

:shadow
     The arguments to :shadow, symbol-names, name symbols that are to be
     created in the package being defined.  These symbols are added to
     the list of shadowing symbols effectively as if by shadow.

:shadowing-import-from
     The symbols named by the argument symbol-names are found (involving
     a lookup as if by find-symbol) in the specified package-name.  The
     resulting symbols are imported into the package being defined, and
     placed on the shadowing symbols list as if by shadowing-import.  In
     no case are symbols created in any package other than the one being
     defined.

:import-from
     The symbols named by the argument symbol-names are found in the
     package named by package-name and they are imported into the
     package being defined.  In no case are symbols created in any
     package other than the one being defined.

:export
     The symbols named by the argument symbol-names are found or created
     in the package being defined and exported.  The :export option
     interacts with the :use option, since inherited symbols can be used
     rather than new ones created.  The :export option interacts with
     the :import-from and :shadowing-import-from options, since imported
     symbols can be used rather than new ones created.  If an argument
     to the :export option is accessible as an (inherited) internal
     symbol via use-package, that the symbol named by symbol-name is
     first imported into the package being defined, and is then exported
     from that package.

:intern
     The symbols named by the argument symbol-names are found or created
     in the package being defined.  The :intern option interacts with
     the :use option, since inherited symbols can be used rather than
     new ones created.

:size
     The argument to the :size option declares the approximate number of
     symbols expected in the package.  This is an efficiency hint only
     and might be ignored by an implementation.

   The order in which the options appear in a defpackage form is
irrelevant.  The order in which they are executed is as follows:

1.
     :shadow and :shadowing-import-from.
2.
     :use.
3.
     :import-from and :intern.
4.
     :export.

   Shadows are established first, since they might be necessary to block
spurious name conflicts when the :use option is processed.  The :use
option is executed next so that :intern and :export options can refer to
normally inherited symbols.  The :export option is executed last so that
it can refer to symbols created by any of the other options; in
particular, shadowing symbols and imported symbols can be made external.

   If a defpackage form appears as a top level form, all of the actions
normally performed by this macro at load time must also be performed at
compile time.

Examples::
..........

      (defpackage "MY-PACKAGE"
        (:nicknames "MYPKG" "MY-PKG")
        (:use "COMMON-LISP")
        (:shadow "CAR" "CDR")
        (:shadowing-import-from "VENDOR-COMMON-LISP"  "CONS")
        (:import-from "VENDOR-COMMON-LISP"  "GC")
        (:export "EQ" "CONS" "FROBOLA")
        )

      (defpackage my-package
        (:nicknames mypkg :MY-PKG)  ; remember Common Lisp conventions for case
        (:use common-lisp)          ; conversion on symbols
        (:shadow CAR :cdr #:cons)
        (:export "CONS")            ; this is the shadowed one.
        )

Affected By::
.............

Existing packages.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

If one of the supplied :nicknames already refers to an existing package,
an error of type package-error is signaled.

   An error of type program-error should be signaled if :size or
:documentation appears more than once.

   Since implementations might allow extended options an error of type
program-error should be signaled if an option is present that is not
actually supported in the host implementation.

   The collection of symbol-name arguments given to the options :shadow,
:intern, :import-from, and :shadowing-import-from must all be disjoint;
additionally, the symbol-name arguments given to :export and :intern
must be disjoint.  Disjoint in this context is defined as no two of the
symbol-names being string= with each other.  If either condition is
violated, an error of type program-error should be signaled.

   For the :shadowing-import-from and :import-from options, a
correctable error of type package-error is signaled if no symbol is
accessible in the package named by package-name for one of the argument
symbol-names.

   Name conflict errors are handled by the underlying calls to
make-package, use-package, import, and export.  See *note Package
Concepts::.

See Also::
..........

*note documentation:: , *note Package Concepts::, *note Compilation::

Notes::
.......

The :intern option is useful if an :import-from or a
:shadowing-import-from option in a subsequent call to defpackage (for
some other package) expects to find these symbols accessible but not
necessarily external.

   It is recommended that the entire package definition is put in a
single place, and that all the package definitions of a program are in a
single file.  This file can be loaded before loading or compiling
anything else that depends on those packages.  Such a file can be read
in the COMMON-LISP-USER package, avoiding any initial state issues.

   defpackage cannot be used to create two "mutually recursive"
packages, such as:

      (defpackage my-package
        (:use common-lisp your-package)    ;requires your-package to exist first
        (:export "MY-FUN"))
      (defpackage your-package
        (:use common-lisp)
        (:import-from my-package "MY-FUN") ;requires my-package to exist first
        (:export "MY-FUN"))

   However, nothing prevents the user from using the package-affecting
functions such as use-package, import, and export to establish such
links after a more standard use of defpackage.

   The macroexpansion of defpackage could usefully canonicalize the
names into strings, so that even if a source file has random symbols in
the defpackage form, the compiled file would only contain strings.

   Frequently additional implementation-dependent options take the form
of a keyword standing by itself as an abbreviation for a list (keyword
T); this syntax should be properly reported as an unrecognized option in
implementations that do not support it.

‘do-symbols’ (var [package [result-form]]) {declaration}* {tag |
statement}*
⇒ {result}*

   ‘do-external-symbols’ (var [package [result-form]]) {declaration}*
{tag | statement}*
⇒ {result}*

   ‘do-all-symbols’ (var [result-form]) {declaration}* {tag |
statement}*
⇒ {result}*

Arguments and Values::
......................

var--a variable name; not evaluated.

   package--a package designator; evaluated.

   The default in do-symbols and do-external-symbols is the current
package.

   result-form--a form; evaluated as described below.  The default is
nil.

   declaration--a declare expression; not evaluated.

   tag--a go tag; not evaluated.

   statement--a compound form; evaluated as described below.

   results--the values returned by the result-form if a normal return
occurs, or else, if an explicit return occurs, the values that were
transferred.

Description::
.............

do-symbols, do-external-symbols, and do-all-symbols iterate over the
symbols of packages.  For each symbol in the set of packages chosen, the
var is bound to the symbol, and the statements in the body are executed.
When all the symbols have been processed, result-form is evaluated and
returned as the value of the macro.

   do-symbols iterates over the symbols accessible in package.

   Statements may execute more than once for symbols that are inherited
from multiple packages.

   do-all-symbols iterates on every registered package.  do-all-symbols
will not process every symbol whatsoever, because a symbol not
accessible in any registered package will not be processed.
do-all-symbols may cause a symbol that is present in several packages to
be processed more than once.

   do-external-symbols iterates on the external symbols of package.

   When result-form is evaluated, var is bound and has the value nil.

   An implicit block named nil surrounds the entire do-symbols,
do-external-symbols, or do-all-symbols form.

   return or return-from may be used to terminate the iteration
prematurely.

   If execution of the body affects which symbols are contained in the
set of packages over which iteration is occurring, other than to remove
the symbol currently the value of var by using unintern, the
consequences are undefined.

   For each of these macros, the scope of the name binding does not
include any initial value form, but the optional result forms are
included.

   Any tag in the body is treated as with tagbody.

Examples::
..........

      (make-package 'temp :use nil) ⇒  #<PACKAGE "TEMP">
      (intern "SHY" 'temp) ⇒  TEMP::SHY, NIL ;SHY will be an internal symbol
                                              ;in the package TEMP
      (export (intern "BOLD" 'temp) 'temp)  ⇒  T  ;BOLD will be external
      (let ((lst ()))
        (do-symbols (s (find-package 'temp)) (push s lst))
        lst)
     ⇒  (TEMP::SHY TEMP:BOLD)
     OR⇒ (TEMP:BOLD TEMP::SHY)
      (let ((lst ()))
        (do-external-symbols (s (find-package 'temp) lst) (push s lst))
        lst)
     ⇒  (TEMP:BOLD)
      (let ((lst ()))
        (do-all-symbols (s lst)
          (when (eq (find-package 'temp) (symbol-package s)) (push s lst)))
        lst)
     ⇒  (TEMP::SHY TEMP:BOLD)
     OR⇒ (TEMP:BOLD TEMP::SHY)

11.2.21 intern [Function]
-------------------------

‘intern’ string &optional package ⇒ symbol, status

Arguments and Values::
......................

string--a string.

   package--a package designator.

   The default is the current package.

   symbol--a symbol.

   status--one of :inherited, :external, :internal, or nil.

Description::
.............

intern enters a symbol named string into package.  If a symbol whose
name is the same as string is already accessible in package, it is
returned.  If no such symbol is accessible in package, a new symbol with
the given name is created and entered into package as an internal
symbol, or as an external symbol if the package is the KEYWORD package;
package becomes the home package of the created symbol.

   The first value returned by intern, symbol, is the symbol that was
found or created.  The meaning of the secondary value, status, is as
follows:

:internal
     The symbol was found and is present in package as an internal
     symbol.

:external
     The symbol was found and is present as an external symbol.

:inherited
     The symbol was found and is inherited via use-package (which
     implies that the symbol is internal).

nil
     No pre-existing symbol was found, so one was created.

     It is implementation-dependent whether the string that becomes the
     new symbol's name is the given string or a copy of it.  Once a
     string has been given as the string argument to intern in this
     situation where a new symbol is created, the consequences are
     undefined if a subsequent attempt is made to alter that string.

Examples::
..........

      (in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER") ⇒  #<PACKAGE "COMMON-LISP-USER">
      (intern "Never-Before") ⇒  |Never-Before|, NIL
      (intern "Never-Before") ⇒  |Never-Before|, :INTERNAL
      (intern "NEVER-BEFORE" "KEYWORD") ⇒  :NEVER-BEFORE, NIL
      (intern "NEVER-BEFORE" "KEYWORD") ⇒  :NEVER-BEFORE, :EXTERNAL

name given.

12.1.1.1 Associativity and Commutativity in Numeric Operations
..............................................................

For functions that are mathematically associative (and possibly
commutative), a conforming implementation may process the arguments in
any manner consistent with associative (and possibly commutative)
rearrangement.  This does not affect the order in which the argument
forms are evaluated; for a discussion of evaluation order, see *note
Function Forms::.  What is unspecified is only the order in which the
parameter values are processed.  This implies that implementations may
differ in which automatic coercions are applied; see *note Contagion in
Numeric Operations::.

   A conforming program can control the order of processing explicitly
by separating the operations into separate (possibly nested) function
forms, or by writing explicit calls to functions that perform coercions.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Examples of Associativity and Commutativity in Numeric Operations,  Next: Contagion in Numeric Operations,  Prev: Associativity and Commutativity in Numeric Operations,  Up: Numeric Operations

12.1.1.2 Examples of Associativity and Commutativity in Numeric Operations
..........................................................................

Consider the following expression, in which we assume that 1.0 and
1.0e-15 both denote single floats:

      (+ 1/3 2/3 1.0d0 1.0 1.0e-15)

   One conforming implementation might process the arguments from left
to right, first adding 1/3 and 2/3 to get 1, then converting that to a
double float for combination with 1.0d0, then successively converting
and adding 1.0 and 1.0e-15.

   Another conforming implementation might process the arguments from
right to left, first performing a single float addition of 1.0 and
1.0e-15 (perhaps losing accuracy in the process), then converting the
sum to a double float and adding 1.0d0, then converting 2/3 to a double
float and adding it, and then converting 1/3 and adding that.

   A third conforming implementation might first scan all the arguments,
process all the rationals first to keep that part of the computation
exact, then find an argument of the largest floating-point format among
all the arguments and add that, and then add in all other arguments,
converting each in turn (all in a perhaps misguided attempt to make the
computation as accurate as possible).

   In any case, all three strategies are legitimate.

   A conforming program could control the order by writing, for example,

      (+ (+ 1/3 2/3) (+ 1.0d0 1.0e-15) 1.0)

The byte-manipulation functions use objects called byte specifiers to
designate the size and position of a specific byte within an integer.
The representation of a byte specifier is implementation-dependent; it
might or might not be a number.  The function byte will construct a byte
specifier, which various other byte-manipulation functions will accept.

12.1.3.1 Rule of Unbounded Rational Precision
.............................................

Rational computations cannot overflow in the usual sense (though there
may not be enough storage to represent a result), since integers and
ratios may in principle be of any magnitude.

12.1.3.2 Rule of Canonical Representation for Rationals
.......................................................

If any computation produces a result that is a mathematical ratio of two
integers such that the denominator evenly divides the numerator, then
the result is converted to the equivalent integer.

   If the denominator does not evenly divide the numerator, the
canonical representation of a rational number is as the ratio that
numerator and that denominator, where the greatest common divisor of the
numerator and denominator is one, and where the denominator is positive
and greater than one.

   When used as input (in the default syntax), the notation -0 always
denotes the integer 0.  A conforming implementation must not have a
representation of "minus zero" for integers that is distinct from its
representation of zero for integers.  However, such a distinction is
possible for floats; see the type float.


File: gcl.info,  Node: Rule of Float Substitutability,  Prev: Rule of Canonical Representation for Rationals,  Up: Rational Computations

12.1.3.3 Rule of Float Substitutability
.......................................

When the arguments to an irrational mathematical function

   [Reviewer Note by Barmar: There should be a table of these
functions.]  are all rational and the true mathematical result is also
(mathematically) rational, then unless otherwise noted an implementation
is free to return either an accurate rational result or a single float
approximation.  If the arguments are all rational but the result cannot
be expressed as a rational number, then a single float approximation is
always returned.

   If the arguments to a mathematical function are all of type (or
rational (complex rational)) and the true mathematical result is
(mathematically) a complex number with rational real and imaginary
parts, then unless otherwise noted an implementation is free to return
either an accurate result of type (or rational (complex rational)) or a

12.1.4.1 Rule of Float and Rational Contagion
.............................................

When rationals and floats are combined by a numerical function, the
rational is first converted to a float of the same format.  For
functions such as + that take more than two arguments, it is permitted
that part of the operation be carried out exactly using rationals and
the rest be done using floating-point arithmetic.

   When rationals and floats are compared by a numerical function, the
function rational is effectively called to convert the float to a
rational and then an exact comparison is performed.  In the case of
complex numbers, the real and imaginary parts are effectively handled
individually.

12.1.4.3 Rule of Float Approximation
....................................

Computations with floats are only approximate, although they are
described as if the results were mathematically accurate.  Two
mathematically identical expressions may be computationally different
because of errors inherent in the floating-point approximation process.
The precision of a float is not necessarily correlated with the accuracy
of that number.  For instance, 3.142857142857142857 is a more precise
approximation to \pi than 3.14159, but the latter is more accurate.  The
precision refers to the number of bits retained in the representation.
When an operation combines a short float with a long float, the result
will be a long float.  Common Lisp functions assume that the accuracy of
arguments to them does not exceed their precision.  Therefore when two
small floats are combined, the result is a small float.  Common Lisp
functions never convert automatically from a larger size to a smaller
one.

12.1.5.3 Rule of Canonical Representation for Complex Rationals
...............................................................

If the result of any computation would be a complex number whose real
part is of type rational and whose imaginary part is zero, the result is
converted to the rational which is the real part.  This rule does not
apply to complex numbers whose parts are floats.  For example, #C(5 0)
and 5 are not different objects in Common Lisp (they are always the same
under eql); #C(5.0 0.0) and 5.0 are always different objects in Common
Lisp (they are never the same under eql, although they are the same
under equalp and =).

File: gcl.info,  Node: Principal Values and Branch Cuts,  Prev: Examples of Rule of Canonical Representation for Complex Rationals,  Up: Complex Computations

12.1.5.5 Principal Values and Branch Cuts
.........................................

Many of the irrational and transcendental functions are multiply defined
in the complex domain; for example, there are in general an infinite
number of complex values for the logarithm function.  In each such case,
a principal value must be chosen for the function to return.  In
general, such values cannot be chosen so as to make the range
continuous; lines in the domain called branch cuts must be defined,
which in turn define the discontinuities in the range.  Common Lisp
defines the branch cuts, principal values, and boundary conditions for
the complex functions following "Principal Values and Branch Cuts in
Complex APL." The branch cut rules that apply to each function are
located with the description of that function.

   Figure 12-9 lists the identities that are obeyed throughout the
applicable portion of the complex domain, even on the branch cuts:

  sin i z = i sinh z  sinh i z = i sin z        arctan i z = i arctanh z
  cos i z = cosh z    cosh i z = cos z          arcsinh i z = i arcsin z
  tan i z = i tanh z  arcsin i z = i arcsinh z  arctanh i z = i arctan z

         Figure 12-9: Trigonometric Identities for Complex Domain


   The quadrant numbers referred to in the discussions of branch cuts
are as illustrated in Figure 12-10.

12.1.6 Interval Designators
---------------------------

The compound type specifier form of the numeric type specifiers in
Figure 12-10 permit the user to specify an interval on the real number
line which describe a subtype of the type which would be described by
the corresponding atomic type specifier.  A subtype of some type T is
specified using an ordered pair of objects called interval designators
for type T.

   The first of the two interval designators for type T can be any of
the following:

a number N of type T
     This denotes a lower inclusive bound of N. That is, elements of the
     subtype of T will be greater than or equal to N.

a singleton list whose element is
     a number M of type T This denotes a lower exclusive bound of M.
     That is, elements of the subtype of T will be greater than M.

the symbol *
     This denotes the absence of a lower bound on the interval.

   The second of the two interval designators for type T can be any of
the following:

a number N of type T
     This denotes an upper inclusive bound of N. That is, elements of
     the subtype of T will be less than or equal to N.

a singleton list whose element is
     a number M of type T This denotes an upper exclusive bound of M.
     That is, elements of the subtype of T will be less than M.

12.2.1 number [System Class]
----------------------------

Class Precedence List::
.......................

number, t

Description::
.............

The type number contains objects which represent mathematical numbers.

   The types real and complex are disjoint subtypes of number.

   The function = tests for numerical equality.  The function eql, when
its arguments are both numbers, tests that they have both the same type
and numerical value.  Two numbers that are the same under eql or = are
not necessarily the same under eq.

Notes::
.......

Common Lisp differs from mathematics on some naming issues.  In
mathematics, the set of real numbers is traditionally described as a
subset of the complex numbers, but in Common Lisp, the type real and the
type complex are disjoint.  The Common Lisp type which includes all
mathematical complex numbers is called number.  The reasons for these
differences include historical precedent, compatibility with most other
popular computer languages, and various issues of time and space
efficiency.

Description::
.............

The type complex includes all mathematical complex numbers other than
those included in the type rational.  Complexes are expressed in
Cartesian form with a real part and an imaginary part, each of which is
a real.  The real part and imaginary part are either both rational or
both of the same float type.  The imaginary part can be a float zero,
but can never be a rational zero, for such a number is always
represented by Common Lisp as a rational rather than a complex.

part are each of type

   This type encompasses those complexes that can result by giving
numbers of type typespec to complex.

Description::
.............

A float is a mathematical rational (but not a Common Lisp rational) of
the form s\cdot f\cdot b^e-p, where s is +1 or -1, the sign; b is an
integer greater than~1, the base or radix of the representation; p is a
positive integer, the precision (in base-b digits) of the float; f is a
positive integer between b^p-1 and b^p-1 (inclusive), the significand;
and e is an integer, the exponent.  The value of p and the range of~e
depends on the implementation and on the type of float within that
implementation.  In addition, there is a floating-point zero; depending
on the implementation, there can also be a "minus zero".  If there is no
minus zero, then 0.0 and~-0.0 are both interpreted as simply a
floating-point zero.  (= 0.0 -0.0) is always true.  If there is a minus
zero, (eql -0.0 0.0) is false, otherwise it is true.

   [Reviewer Note by Barmar: What about IEEE NaNs and infinities?]

   [Reviewer Note by RWK: In the following, what is the "ordering"?
precision?  range?  Can there be additional subtypes of float or does
"others" in the list of four?]

   The types short-float, single-float, double-float, and long-float are
subtypes of type float.  Any two of them must be either disjoint types
or the same type; if the same type, then any other types between them in
the above ordering must also be the same type.  For example, if the type
single-float and the type long-float are the same type, then the type
double-float must be the same type also.

12.2.16 max, min [Function]
---------------------------

‘max’ &rest reals^+ ⇒ max-real

   ‘min’ &rest reals^+ ⇒ min-real

Arguments and Values::
......................

real--a real.

   max-real, min-real--a real.

Description::
.............

max returns the real that is greatest (closest to positive infinity).
min returns the real that is least (closest to negative infinity).

   For max, the implementation has the choice of returning the largest
argument as is or applying the rules of floating-point contagion, taking
all the arguments into consideration for contagion purposes.  Also, if
one or more of the arguments are =, then any one of them may be chosen
as the value to return.  For example, if the reals are a mixture of
rationals and floats, and the largest argument is a rational, then the
implementation is free to produce either that rational or its float
approximation; if the largest argument is a float of a smaller format
than the largest format of any float argument, then the implementation
is free to return the argument in its given format or expanded to the
larger format.  Similar remarks apply to min (replacing "largest
argument" by "smallest argument").

Examples::
..........

      (max 3) ⇒  3
      (min 3) ⇒  3
      (max 6 12) ⇒  12
      (min 6 12) ⇒  6

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a real.

   divisor--a non-zero real.  The default is the integer 1.

   quotient--for floor, ceiling, truncate, and round: an integer; for
ffloor, fceiling, ftruncate, and fround: a float.

   remainder--a real.

Description::
.............

These functions divide number by divisor, returning a quotient and
remainder, such that

   quotient\cdot divisor+remainder=number

   The quotient always represents a mathematical integer.  When more
than one mathematical integer might be possible (i.e., when the
remainder is not zero), the kind of rounding or truncation depends on
the operator:

floor, ffloor
     floor and ffloor produce a quotient that has been truncated toward
     negative infinity; that is, the quotient represents the largest
     mathematical integer that is not larger than the mathematical
     quotient.

ceiling, fceiling
     ceiling and fceiling produce a quotient that has been truncated
     toward positive infinity; that is, the quotient represents the
     smallest mathematical integer that is not smaller than the
     mathematical result.

truncate, ftruncate
     truncate and ftruncate produce a quotient that has been truncated
     towards zero; that is, the quotient represents the mathematical
     integer of the same sign as the mathematical quotient, and that has
     the greatest integral magnitude not greater than that of the
     mathematical quotient.

round, fround
     round and fround produce a quotient that has been rounded to the
     nearest mathematical integer; if the mathematical quotient is
     exactly halfway between two integers, (that is, it has the form
     integer+1\over2), then the quotient has been rounded to the even
     (divisible by two) integer.

   All of these functions perform type conversion operations on numbers.

   The remainder is an integer if both x and y are integers, is a
rational if both x and y are rationals, and is a float if either x or y
is a float.

   ffloor, fceiling, ftruncate, and fround handle arguments of different
types in the following way: If number is a float, and divisor is not a
float of longer format, then the first result is a float of the same
type as number.  Otherwise, the first result is of the type determined
by contagion rules; see *note Contagion in Numeric Operations::.

Examples::
..........

      (floor 3/2) ⇒  1, 1/2
      (ceiling 3 2) ⇒  2, -1

      |>  -2.5 -3 -2 -2 -2
      |>  -2.6 -3 -2 -2 -3
     ⇒  NIL

Notes::
.......

When only number is given, the two results are exact; the mathematical
sum of the two results is always equal to the mathematical value of
number.

   (function number divisor) and (function (/ number divisor)) (where
function is any of one of floor, ceiling, ffloor, fceiling, truncate,
round, ftruncate, and fround) return the same first value, but they
return different remainders as the second value.  For example:

      (floor 5 2) ⇒  2, 1
      (floor (/ 5 2)) ⇒  2, 1/2

   If an effect is desired that is similar to round, but that always
rounds up or down (rather than toward the nearest even integer) if the
mathematical quotient is exactly halfway between two integers, the
programmer should consider a construction such as (floor (+ x 1/2)) or
(ceiling (- x 1/2)).

   radians--a number (of radians).

Description::
.............

asin, acos, and atan compute the arc sine, arc cosine, and arc tangent
respectively.

   The arc sine, arc cosine, and arc tangent (with only number1
supplied) functions can be defined mathematically for number or number1
specified as x as in Figure 12-13.

  Function     Definition
  Arc sine      -i log  (ix+ \sqrt1-x^2 )
  Arc cosine    (\pi/2) - arcsin  x
  Arc tangent   -i log  ((1+ix) \sqrt1/(1+x^2) )

  Figure 12-13: Mathematical definition of arc sine, arc cosine, and arc tangent


   These formulae are mathematically correct, assuming completely
accurate computation.  They are not necessarily the simplest ones for
real-valued computations.

   If both number1 and number2 are supplied for atan, the result is the
arc tangent of number1/number2.  The value of atan is always between
-\pi (exclusive) and~\pi (inclusive)

   when minus zero is not supported.  The range of the two-argument arc
tangent when minus zero is supported includes -\pi.

   For a

   real

   number1, the result is

   a real

   and lies between -\pi/2 and~\pi/2 (both exclusive).  number1 can be a
complex if number2 is not supplied.  If both are supplied, number2 can
be zero provided number1 is not zero.

   [Reviewer Note by Barmar: Should add "However, if the implementation
distinguishes positive and negative zero, both may be signed zeros, and
limits are used to define the result."]

   The following definition for arc sine determines the range and branch
cuts:

                arcsin z = -i log (iz+\sqrt1-z^2\Bigr)

   The branch cut for the arc sine function is in two pieces: one along
the negative real axis to the left of~-1 (inclusive), continuous with
quadrant II, and one along the positive real axis to the right of~1
(inclusive), continuous with quadrant IV. The range is that strip of the
complex plane containing numbers whose real part is between -\pi/2
and~\pi/2.  A number with real part equal to -\pi/2 is in the range if
and only if its imaginary part is non-negative; a number with real part
equal to \pi/2 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is
non-positive.

   The following definition for arc cosine determines the range and
branch cuts:

                    arccos z = \pi\over2 - arcsin z

   or, which are equivalent,

                arccos z = -i log (z+i \sqrt1-z^2\Bigr)

        arccos z = 2 log (\sqrt(1+z)/2 + i \sqrt(1-z)/2)\overi

   The branch cut for the arc cosine function is in two pieces: one
along the negative real axis to the left of~-1 (inclusive), continuous
with quadrant II, and one along the positive real axis to the right of~1
(inclusive), continuous with quadrant IV. This is the same branch cut as
for arc sine.  The range is that strip of the complex plane containing
numbers whose real part is between 0 and~\pi.  A number with real part
equal to 0 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is
non-negative; a number with real part equal to \pi is in the range if
and only if its imaginary part is non-positive.

   The following definition for (one-argument) arc tangent determines
the range and branch cuts:

               arctan z = log (1+iz) - log (1-iz)\over2i

   Beware of simplifying this formula; "obvious" simplifications are
likely to alter the branch cuts or the values on the branch cuts
incorrectly.  The branch cut for the arc tangent function is in two
pieces: one along the positive imaginary axis above i (exclusive),
continuous with quadrant II, and one along the negative imaginary axis
below -i (exclusive), continuous with quadrant IV. The points i and~-i
are excluded from the domain.  The range is that strip of the complex
plane containing numbers whose real part is between -\pi/2 and~\pi/2.  A
number with real part equal to -\pi/2 is in the range if and only if its
imaginary part is strictly positive; a number with real part equal to
\pi/2 is in the range if and only if its imaginary part is strictly
negative.  Thus the range of arc tangent is identical to that of arc
sine with the points -\pi/2 and~\pi/2 excluded.

   For atan, the signs of number1 (indicated as x) and number2
(indicated as y) are used to derive quadrant information.  Figure 12-14
details various special cases.

   The asterisk (*) indicates that the entry in the figure applies to
implementations that support minus zero.

These functions compute the hyperbolic sine, cosine, tangent, arc sine,
arc cosine, and arc tangent functions, which are mathematically defined
for an argument x as given in Figure 12-15.

    Figure 12-15: Mathematical definitions for hyperbolic functions


   The following definition for the inverse hyperbolic cosine determines
the range and branch cuts:

         arccosh z = 2 log (\sqrt(z+1)/2 + \sqrt(z-1)/2\Bigr).

   The branch cut for the inverse hyperbolic cosine function lies along
the real axis to the left of~1 (inclusive), extending indefinitely along
the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II and (between 0
and~1) with quadrant I. The range is that half-strip of the complex
plane containing numbers whose real part is non-negative and whose
imaginary part is between -\pi (exclusive) and~\pi (inclusive).  A
number with real part zero is in the range if its imaginary part is
between zero (inclusive) and~\pi (inclusive).

   The following definition for the inverse hyperbolic sine determines
the range and branch cuts:

                 arcsinh z = log (z+\sqrt1+z^2\Bigr).

   The branch cut for the inverse hyperbolic sine function is in two
pieces: one along the positive imaginary axis above i (inclusive),
continuous with quadrant I, and one along the negative imaginary axis
below -i (inclusive), continuous with quadrant III. The range is that
strip of the complex plane containing numbers whose imaginary part is
between -\pi/2 and~\pi/2.  A number with imaginary part equal to -\pi/2
is in the range if and only if its real part is non-positive; a number
with imaginary part equal to \pi/2 is in the range if and only if its
imaginary part is non-negative.

   The following definition for the inverse hyperbolic tangent
determines the range and branch cuts:

               arctanh z = log (1+z) - log (1-z)\over2.

   Note that:

                       i arctan z = arctanh iz.

   The branch cut for the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is in two
pieces: one along the negative real axis to the left of -1 (inclusive),
continuous with quadrant III, and one along the positive real axis to
the right of~1 (inclusive), continuous with quadrant I. The points -1
and~1 are excluded from the domain.  The range is that strip of the
complex plane containing numbers whose imaginary part is between -\pi/2
and \pi/2.  A number with imaginary part equal to -\pi/2 is in the range
if and only if its real part is strictly negative; a number with
imaginary part equal to \pi/2 is in the range if and only if its
imaginary part is strictly positive.  Thus the range of the inverse
hyperbolic tangent function is identical to that of the inverse
hyperbolic sine function with the points -\pi i/2 and~\pi i/2 excluded.

Examples::
..........

      (sinh 0) ⇒  0.0
      (cosh (complex 0 -1)) ⇒  #C(0.540302 -0.0)

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if number is not a number.
Might signal arithmetic-error.

Notes::
.......

The result of acosh may be a complex even if number is not a complex;
this occurs when number is less than one.  Also, the result of atanh may
be a complex even if number is not a complex; this occurs when the
absolute value of number is greater than one.

   The branch cut formulae are mathematically correct, assuming
completely accurate computation.  Implementors should consult a good
text on numerical analysis.  The formulae given above are not
necessarily the simplest ones for real-valued computations; they are
chosen to define the branch cuts in desirable ways for the complex case.

----------------------

‘abs’ number ⇒ absolute-value

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a number.

   absolute-value--a non-negative real.

Description::
.............

abs returns the absolute value of number.

   If number is

   a real,

   the result is of the same type as number.

   If number is a complex, the result is a positive

   real

   with the same magnitude as number.  The result can be a float

   [Reviewer Note by Barmar: Single-float.]  even if number's components
are rationals and an exact rational result would have been possible.
Thus the result of (abs #c(3 4)) can be either 5 or 5.0, depending on

12.2.31 exp, expt [Function]
----------------------------

‘exp’ number ⇒ result

   ‘expt’ base-number power-number ⇒ result

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a number.

   base-number--a number.

   power-number--a number.

   result--a number.

Description::
.............

exp and expt perform exponentiation.

   exp returns e raised to the power number, where e is the base of the
natural logarithms.  exp has no branch cut.

   expt returns base-number raised to the power power-number.  If the
base-number is a rational and power-number is an integer, the
calculation is exact and the result will be of type rational; otherwise
a floating-point approximation might result.

   For expt of a complex rational to an integer power, the calculation
must be exact and the result is of type (or rational (complex
rational)).

   The result of expt can be a complex, even when neither argument is a
complex, if base-number is negative and power-number is not an integer.
The result is always the principal complex value.  For example, (expt -8
1/3) is not permitted to return -2, even though -2 is one of the cube
roots of -8.  The principal cube root is a complex approximately equal
to #C(1.0 1.73205), not -2.

   expt is defined as b^x = e^x log b\/.  This defines the principal
values precisely.  The range of expt is the entire complex plane.
Regarded as a function of x, with b fixed, there is no branch cut.
Regarded as a function of b, with x fixed, there is in general a branch
cut along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II. The
domain excludes the origin.  By definition, 0^0=1.  If b=0 and the real
part of x is strictly positive, then b^x=0.  For all other values of x,
0^x is an error.

   When power-number is an integer 0, then the result is always the
value one in the type of base-number, even if the base-number is zero
(of any type).  That is:

      (expt x 0) ≡ (coerce 1 (type-of x))

   If power-number is a zero of any other type, then the result is also
the value one, in the type of the arguments after the application of the
contagion rules in *note Contagion in Numeric Operations::, with one
exception: the consequences are undefined if base-number is zero when
power-number is zero and not of type integer.

Examples::
..........

      (exp 0) ⇒  1.0
      (exp 1) ⇒  2.718282
      (exp (log 5)) ⇒  5.0
      (expt 2 8) ⇒  256
      (expt 4 .5) ⇒  2.0
      (expt #c(0 1) 2) ⇒  -1
      (expt #c(2 2) 3) ⇒  #C(-16 16)
      (expt #c(2 2) 4) ⇒  -64

..........

*note log:: , *note Rule of Float Substitutability::

Notes::
.......

Implementations of expt are permitted to use different algorithms for
the cases of a power-number of type rational and a power-number of type
float.

   Note that by the following logic, (sqrt (expt x 3)) is not equivalent
to (expt x 3/2).

      (setq x (exp (/ (* 2 pi #c(0 1)) 3)))         ;exp(2.pi.i/3)

12.2.35 log [Function]
----------------------

‘log’ number &optional base ⇒ logarithm

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a non-zero number.

   base--a number.

   logarithm--a number.

Description::
.............

log returns the logarithm of number in base base.  If base is not
supplied its value is e, the base of the natural logarithms.

   log may return a complex when given a

   real

   negative number.

      (log -1.0) ≡ (complex 0.0 (float pi 0.0))

   If base is zero, log returns zero.

   The result of (log 8 2) may be either 3 or 3.0, depending on the
implementation.  An implementation can use floating-point calculations
even if an exact integer result is possible.

   The branch cut for the logarithm function of one argument (natural
logarithm) lies along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant
II. The domain excludes the origin.

   The mathematical definition of a complex logarithm is as follows,
whether or not minus zero is supported by the implementation:

     (log x) ≡ (complex (log (abs x)) (phase x))

   Therefore the range of the one-argument logarithm function is that
strip of the complex plane containing numbers with imaginary parts
between

   -\pi (exclusive) and~\pi (inclusive) if minus zero is not supported,
or -\pi (inclusive) and~\pi (inclusive) if minus zero is supported.

   The two-argument logarithm function is defined as

      (log base number)
      ≡ (/ (log number) (log base))

   This defines the principal values precisely.  The range of the
two-argument logarithm function is the entire complex plane.

Examples::
..........

      (log 100 10)
     ⇒  2.0
     ⇒  2
      (log 100.0 10) ⇒  2.0
      (log #c(0 1) #c(0 -1))
     ⇒  #C(-1.0 0.0)
     OR⇒ #C(-1 0)
      (log 8.0 2) ⇒  3.0

      (log #c(-16 16) #c(2 2)) ⇒  3 or approximately #c(3.0 0.0)
                                    or approximately 3.0 (unlikely)

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a real.

   divisor--a real.

   modulus, remainder--a real.

Description::
.............

mod and rem are generalizations of the modulus and remainder functions
respectively.

   mod performs the operation floor on number and divisor and returns
the remainder of the floor operation.

   rem performs the operation truncate on number and divisor and returns
the remainder of the truncate operation.

12.2.37 signum [Function]
-------------------------

‘signum’ number ⇒ signed-prototype

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a number.

   signed-prototype--a number.

Description::
.............

signum determines a numerical value that indicates whether number is
negative, zero, or positive.

   For a rational, signum returns one of -1, 0, or 1 according to
whether number is negative, zero, or positive.  For a float, the result
is a float of the same format whose value is minus one, zero, or one.
For a complex number z, (signum z) is a complex number of the same phase
but with unit magnitude, unless z is a complex zero, in which case the
result is z.

   For rational arguments, signum is a rational function, but it may be
irrational for complex arguments.

   If number is a float, the result is a float.  If number is a
rational, the result is a rational.  If number is a complex float, the
result is a complex float.  If number is a complex rational, the result
is a complex, but it is implementation-dependent whether that result is
a complex rational or a complex float.

Examples::
..........

      (signum 0) ⇒  0
      (signum 99) ⇒  1
      (signum 4/5) ⇒  1
      (signum -99/100) ⇒  -1

‘sqrt’ number ⇒ root

Arguments and Values::
......................

number, root--a number.

   natural, natural-root--a non-negative integer.

Description::
.............

sqrt and isqrt compute square roots.

   sqrt returns the principal square root of number.  If the number is
not a complex but is negative, then the result is a complex.

   isqrt returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the exact
positive square root of natural.

   If number is a positive rational, it is implementation-dependent
whether root is a rational or a float.  If number is a negative
rational, it is implementation-dependent whether root is a complex
rational or a complex float.

   The mathematical definition of complex square root (whether or not
minus zero is supported) follows:

   (sqrt x) = (exp (/ (log x) 2))

   The branch cut for square root lies along the negative real axis,
continuous with quadrant II. The range consists of the right half-plane,
including the non-negative imaginary axis and excluding the negative
imaginary axis.

Examples::
..........

      (sqrt 9.0) ⇒  3.0
      (sqrt -9.0) ⇒  #C(0.0 3.0)
      (isqrt 9) ⇒  3
      (sqrt 12) ⇒  3.4641016
      (isqrt 12) ⇒  3
      (isqrt 300) ⇒  17
      (isqrt 325) ⇒  18
      (sqrt 25)
     ⇒  5

      (isqrt 25) ⇒  5
      (sqrt -1) ⇒  #C(0.0 1.0)
      (sqrt #c(0 2)) ⇒  #C(1.0 1.0)

Exceptional Situations::

Arguments and Values::

Description::
.............

complex returns a number whose real part is realpart and whose imaginary
part is imagpart.

   If realpart is a rational and imagpart is the rational number zero,
the result of complex is realpart, a rational.  Otherwise, the result is
a complex.

   If either realpart or imagpart is a float, the non-float is converted
to a float before the complex is created.  If imagpart is not supplied,
the imaginary part is a zero of the same type as realpart; i.e., (coerce
0 (type-of realpart)) is effectively used.

   Type upgrading implies a movement upwards in the type hierarchy
lattice.  In the case of complexes, the type-specifier

   [Reviewer Note by Barmar: What type specifier?]  must be a subtype of
(upgraded-complex-part-type type-specifier).  If type-specifier1 is a
subtype of type-specifier2, then (upgraded-complex-element-type
'type-specifier1) must also be a subtype of
(upgraded-complex-element-type 'type-specifier2).  Two disjoint types
can be upgraded into the same thing.

phase returns the phase of number (the angle part of its polar
representation) in radians, in the range

   -\pi (exclusive) if minus zero is not supported, or -\pi (inclusive)
if minus zero is supported,

   to \pi (inclusive).  The phase of a positive

   real

   number is zero; that of a negative

   real

   number is \pi.  The phase of zero is defined to be zero.

   If number is a complex float, the result is a float of the same type
as the components of number.  If number is a float, the result is a
float of the same type.  If number is a rational or a complex rational,
the result is a single float.

   The branch cut for phase lies along the negative real axis,
continuous with quadrant II. The range consists of that portion of the
real axis between -\pi (exclusive) and~\pi (inclusive).

12.2.53 numerator, denominator [Function]
-----------------------------------------

‘numerator’ rational ⇒ numerator

   ‘denominator’ rational ⇒ denominator

Arguments and Values::
......................

rational--a rational.

   numerator--an integer.

Description::
.............

numerator and denominator reduce rational to canonical form and compute
the numerator or denominator of that number.

   numerator and denominator return the numerator or denominator of the
canonical form of rational.

   If rational is an integer, numerator returns rational and denominator
returns 1.

12.2.54 rational, rationalize [Function]
----------------------------------------

‘rational’ number ⇒ rational

   ‘rationalize’ number ⇒ rational

Arguments and Values::
......................

number--a real.

   rational--a rational.

Description::
.............

rational and rationalize convert

   reals

   to rationals.

   If number is already rational, it is returned.

   If number is a float, rational returns a rational that is
mathematically equal in value to the float.  rationalize returns a
rational that approximates the float to the accuracy of the underlying
floating-point representation.

   rational assumes that the float is completely accurate.

   rationalize assumes that the float is accurate only to the precision
of the floating-point representation.

Examples::
..........

      (rational 0) ⇒  0
      (rationalize -11/100) ⇒  -11/100
      (rational .1) ⇒  13421773/134217728 ;implementation-dependent
      (rationalize .1) ⇒  1/10

Affected By::
.............

The implementation.

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if number is not a real.
Might signal arithmetic-error.

Notes::
.......

It is always the case that

      (float (rational x) x) ≡ x

   and

      (float (rationalize x) x) ≡ x

   That is, rationalizing a float by either method and then converting
it back to a float of the same format produces the original number.

12.2.56 ash [Function]
----------------------

‘ash’ integer count ⇒ shifted-integer

Arguments and Values::
......................

integer--an integer.

   count--an integer.

   shifted-integer--an integer.

Description::
.............

ash performs the arithmetic shift operation on the binary representation
of integer, which is treated as if it were binary.

   ash shifts integer arithmetically left by count bit positions if
count is positive, or right count bit positions if count is negative.
The shifted value of the same sign as integer is returned.

   Mathematically speaking, ash performs the computation
floor(integer\cdot 2^count).  Logically, ash moves all of the bits in
integer to the left, adding zero-bits at the right, or moves them to the
right, discarding bits.

   ash is defined to behave as if integer were represented in two's
complement form, regardless of how integers are represented internally.

Examples::
..........

      (ash 16 1) ⇒  32
      (ash 16 0) ⇒  16
      (ash 16 -1) ⇒  8
      (ash -100000000000000000000000000000000 -100) ⇒  -79

Exceptional Situations::

12.2.57 integer-length [Function]
---------------------------------

‘integer-length’ integer ⇒ number-of-bits

Arguments and Values::
......................

integer--an integer.

   number-of-bits--a non-negative integer.

Description::
.............

Returns the number of bits needed to represent integer in binary
two's-complement format.

Examples::
..........

      (integer-length 0) ⇒  0
      (integer-length 1) ⇒  1
      (integer-length 3) ⇒  2
      (integer-length 4) ⇒  3
      (integer-length 7) ⇒  3
      (integer-length -1) ⇒  0
      (integer-length -4) ⇒  2
      (integer-length -7) ⇒  3
      (integer-length -8) ⇒  3
      (integer-length (expt 2 9)) ⇒  10
      (integer-length (1- (expt 2 9))) ⇒  9
      (integer-length (- (expt 2 9))) ⇒  9
      (integer-length (- (1+ (expt 2 9)))) ⇒  10

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if integer is not an integer.

Notes::
.......

This function could have been defined by:

     (defun integer-length (integer)
       (ceiling (log (if (minusp integer)
                         (- integer)
                         (1+ integer))
                     2)))

   If integer is non-negative, then its value can be represented in
unsigned binary form in a field whose width in bits is no smaller than
(integer-length integer).  Regardless of the sign of integer, its value
can be represented in signed binary two's-complement form in a field
whose width in bits is no smaller than (+ (integer-length integer) 1).

12.2.59 parse-integer [Function]
--------------------------------

‘parse-integer’ string &key start end radix junk-allowed ⇒ integer, pos

Arguments and Values::
......................

string--a string.

   start, end--bounding index designators of string.  The defaults for
start and end are 0 and nil, respectively.

   radix--a radix.  The default is 10.

   junk-allowed--a generalized boolean.  The default is false.

   integer--an integer or false.

   pos--a bounding index of string.

Description::
.............

parse-integer parses an integer in the specified radix from the
substring of string delimited by start and end.

   parse-integer expects an optional sign (+ or -) followed by a a
non-empty sequence of digits to be interpreted in the specified radix.
Optional leading and trailing whitespace_1 is ignored.

   parse-integer does not recognize the syntactic radix-specifier
prefixes #O, #B, #X, and #nR, nor does it recognize a trailing decimal
point.

   If junk-allowed is false, an error of type parse-error is signaled if
substring does not consist entirely of the representation of a signed
integer, possibly surrounded on either side by whitespace_1 characters.

   The first value returned is either the integer that was parsed, or
else nil if no syntactically correct integer was seen but junk-allowed
was true.

   The second value is either the index into the string of the delimiter
that terminated the parse, or the upper bounding index of the substring
if the parse terminated at the end of the substring (as is always the
case if junk-allowed is false).

Examples::
..........

      (parse-integer "123") ⇒  123, 3
      (parse-integer "123" :start 1 :radix 5) ⇒  13, 3
      (parse-integer "no-integer" :junk-allowed t) ⇒  NIL, 0

Exceptional Situations::
........................

If junk-allowed is false, an error is signaled if substring does not
consist entirely of the representation of an integer, possibly
surrounded on either side by whitespace_1 characters.

12.2.64 logcount [Function]
---------------------------

‘logcount’ integer ⇒ number-of-on-bits

Arguments and Values::
......................

integer--an integer.

   number-of-on-bits--a non-negative integer.

Description::
.............

Computes and returns the number of bits in the two's-complement binary
representation of integer that are 'on' or 'set'.  If integer is
negative, the 0 bits are counted; otherwise, the 1 bits are counted.

Examples::
..........

      (logcount 0) ⇒  0
      (logcount -1) ⇒  0
      (logcount 7) ⇒  3
      (logcount  13) ⇒  3 ;Two's-complement binary: ...0001101
      (logcount -13) ⇒  2 ;Two's-complement binary: ...1110011
      (logcount  30) ⇒  4 ;Two's-complement binary: ...0011110
      (logcount -30) ⇒  4 ;Two's-complement binary: ...1100010
      (logcount (expt 2 100)) ⇒  1
      (logcount (- (expt 2 100))) ⇒  100
      (logcount (- (1+ (expt 2 100)))) ⇒  1

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal type-error if its argument is not an integer.

Notes::
.......

Even if the implementation does not represent integers internally in
two's complement binary, logcount behaves as if it did.

   The following identity always holds:

         (logcount x)
      ≡ (logcount (- (+ x 1)))
      ≡ (logcount (lognot x))

12.2.65 logtest [Function]
--------------------------

‘logtest’ integer-1 integer-2 ⇒ generalized-boolean

Arguments and Values::
......................

integer-1--an integer.

   integer-2--an integer.

   generalized-boolean--a generalized boolean.

Description::
.............

Returns true if any of the bits designated by the 1's in integer-1 is 1
in integer-2; otherwise it is false.  integer-1 and integer-2 are
treated as if they were binary.

   Negative integer-1 and integer-2 are treated as if they were
represented in two's-complement binary.

Examples::
..........

      (logtest 1 7) ⇒  true
      (logtest 1 2) ⇒  false
      (logtest -2 -1) ⇒  true
      (logtest 0 -1) ⇒  false

Exceptional Situations::
........................

Should signal an error of type type-error if integer-1 is not an
integer.  Should signal an error of type type-error if integer-2 is not
an integer.

12.2.66 byte, byte-size, byte-position [Function]
-------------------------------------------------

‘byte’ size position ⇒ bytespec

   ‘byte-size’ bytespec ⇒ size

   ‘byte-position’ bytespec ⇒ position

Arguments and Values::
......................

size, position--a non-negative integer.

   bytespec--a byte specifier.

Description::
.............

byte returns a byte specifier that indicates a byte of width size and
whose bits have weights 2^position + size - 1\/ through 2^position, and
whose representation is implementation-dependent.

   byte-size returns the number of bits specified by bytespec.

   byte-position returns the position specified by bytespec.

Examples::
..........

      (setq b (byte 100 200)) ⇒  #<BYTE-SPECIFIER size 100 position 200>
      (byte-size b) ⇒  100
      (byte-position b) ⇒  200

Notes::
.......

      (byte-size (byte j k)) ≡ j
      (byte-position (byte j k)) ≡ k

   A byte of size of 0 is permissible; it refers to a byte of width
zero.  For example,

      (ldb (byte 0 3) #o7777) ⇒  0
      (dpb #o7777 (byte 0 3) 0) ⇒  0

Arguments and Values::
......................

newbyte--an integer.

   bytespec--a byte specifier.

   integer--an integer.

   result-integer--an integer.

Description::
.............

Replaces a field of bits within integer; specifically, returns an
integer that contains the bits of newbyte within the byte specified by
bytespec, and elsewhere contains the bits of integer.

Examples::
..........

      (deposit-field 7 (byte 2 1) 0) ⇒  6
      (deposit-field -1 (byte 4 0) 0) ⇒  15
      (deposit-field 0 (byte 2 1) -3) ⇒  -7

12.2.68 dpb [Function]
----------------------

‘dpb’ newbyte bytespec integer ⇒ result-integer

Pronunciation::
...............

pronounced ,de 'pib or pronounced ,de 'pe b or pronounced 'd\=e 'p\=e
'b\=e

Arguments and Values::
......................

newbyte--an integer.

   bytespec--a byte specifier.

   integer--an integer.

   result-integer--an integer.

Description::
.............

dpb (deposit byte) is used to replace a field of bits within integer.
dpb returns an integer that is the same as integer except in the bits
specified by bytespec.

   Let s be the size specified by bytespec; then the low s bits of
newbyte appear in the result in the byte specified by bytespec.  Newbyte
is interpreted as being right-justified, as if it were the result of
ldb.

Examples::
..........

      (dpb 1 (byte 1 10) 0) ⇒  1024
      (dpb -2 (byte 2 10) 0) ⇒  2048
      (dpb 1 (byte 2 10) 2048) ⇒  1024

             (logbitp j n))

   In general,

      (dpb x (byte 0 y) z) ⇒  z

   for all valid values of x, y, and z.

   Historically, the name "dpb" comes from a DEC PDP-10 assembly
language instruction meaning "deposit byte."

12.2.69 ldb [Accessor]
----------------------

‘ldb’ bytespec integer ⇒ byte

   (setf (‘ ldb’ bytespec place) new-byte)

Pronunciation::
...............

pronounced 'lid ib or pronounced 'lid e b or pronounced 'el 'd\=e 'b\=e

Arguments and Values::
......................

bytespec--a byte specifier.

   integer--an integer.

   byte, new-byte--a non-negative integer.

Description::
.............

ldb extracts and returns the byte of integer specified by bytespec.

   ldb returns an integer in which the bits with weights 2^(s-1) through
2^0 are the same as those in integer with weights 2^(p+s-1) through 2^p,
and all other bits zero; s is (byte-size bytespec) and p is
(byte-position bytespec).

   setf may be used with ldb to modify a byte within the integer that is
stored in a given place.

   The order of evaluation, when an ldb form is supplied to setf, is
exactly left-to-right.

   The effect is to perform a dpb operation and then store the result
back into the place.

Examples::
..........

      (ldb (byte 2 1) 10) ⇒  1
      (setq a (list 8)) ⇒  (8)
      (setf (ldb (byte 2 1) (car a)) 1) ⇒  1
      a ⇒  (10)

   In general,

      (ldb (byte 0 x) y) ⇒  0

   for all valid values of x and y.

   Historically, the name "ldb" comes from a DEC PDP-10 assembly
language instruction meaning "load byte."

bytespec--a byte specifier.

   integer--an integer.

   generalized-boolean--a generalized boolean.

Description::
.............

Returns true if any of the bits of the byte in integer specified by
bytespec is non-zero; otherwise returns false.

Examples::
..........

      (ldb-test (byte 4 1) 16) ⇒  true
      (ldb-test (byte 3 1) 16) ⇒  false
      (ldb-test (byte 3 2) 16) ⇒  true

12.2.71 mask-field [Accessor]
-----------------------------

‘mask-field’ bytespec integer ⇒ masked-integer

   (setf (‘ mask-field’ bytespec place) new-masked-integer)

Arguments and Values::
......................

bytespec--a byte specifier.

   integer--an integer.

   masked-integer, new-masked-integer--a non-negative integer.

Description::
.............

mask-field performs a "mask" operation on integer.  It returns an
integer that has the same bits as integer in the byte specified by
bytespec, but that has zero-bits everywhere else.

   setf may be used with mask-field to modify a byte within the integer
that is stored in a given place.  The effect is to perform a
deposit-field operation and then store the result back into the place.

Examples::
..........

      (mask-field (byte 1 5) -1) ⇒  32
      (setq a 15) ⇒  15
      (mask-field (byte 2 0) a) ⇒  3
      a ⇒  15
      (setf (mask-field (byte 2 0) a) 1) ⇒  1
      a ⇒  13
