@subsection Introduction to Streams

A @i{stream}
@IGindex stream
 is an @i{object} that can be used with an input or output
function to identify an appropriate source or sink of @i{characters} or 
@i{bytes} for that operation.
A @i{character}
@IGindex character
 @i{stream}
@IGindex stream
 is a source or sink of @i{characters}.
A @i{binary}
@IGindex binary
 @i{stream}
@IGindex stream
 is a source or sink of @i{bytes}.

Some operations may be performed on any kind of @i{stream};
Figure 21--1 provides a list of @i{standardized} operations
that are potentially useful with any kind of @i{stream}.

Other operations are only meaningful on certain @i{stream} @i{types}.
For example, @b{read-char} is only defined for @i{character} @i{streams}
and @b{read-byte} is only defined for @i{binary} @i{streams}.

@subsubsection Input, Output, and Bidirectional Streams

A @i{stream}, whether a @i{character} @i{stream} or a @i{binary} @i{stream},
can be an @i{input}
@IGindex input
 @i{stream}
@IGindex stream
 (source of data),
       an @i{output}
@IGindex output
 @i{stream}
@IGindex stream
 (sink for data),
       both, 
    or (@i{e.g.}, when ``@t{:direction :probe}'' is given to @b{open}) neither.

Figure 21--2 shows @i{operators} relating to
@i{input} @i{streams}.

@node Open and Closed Streams, Interactive Streams, Input, Introduction to Streams
@subsubsection Open and Closed Streams

@i{Streams} are either @i{open}
@IGindex open
 or @i{closed}
@IGindex closed
.  

Except as explicitly specified otherwise,
operations that create and return @i{streams} return @i{open} @i{streams}.

The action of @i{closing} a @i{stream} marks the end of its use as a source
or sink of data, permitting the @i{implementation} to reclaim its internal data
structures, and to free any external resources which might have been locked by the
@i{stream} when it was opened.

Except as explicitly specified otherwise,
the consequences are undefined when a @i{closed} @i{stream} 
is used where a @i{stream} is called for.

Coercion of @i{streams} to @i{pathnames} 
is permissible for @i{closed} @i{streams};
in some situations, such as for a @i{truename} computation, 
the result might be different for an @i{open} @i{stream}
and for that same @i{stream} once it has been @i{closed}.

@node Interactive Streams, Abstract Classifications of Streams, Open and Closed Streams, Introduction to Streams
@subsubsection Interactive Streams

An @i{interactive stream}
@IGindex interactive stream
 is one on which it makes sense to perform
interactive querying.

The precise meaning of an @i{interactive stream} is
@i{implementation-defined}, and may depend on the underlying
operating system.  Some examples of the things that an
@i{implementation} might choose to use as identifying characteristics
of an @i{interactive stream} include:

@table @asis

@item @t{*}  
The @i{stream} is connected to a person (or equivalent) in such a way
  that the program can prompt for information and expect to receive different
  input depending on the prompt.

@item @t{*}  
The program is expected to prompt for input and support ``normal input editing''.

@item @t{*}  
@b{read-char} might wait for the user to type something before returning
  instead of immediately returning a character or end-of-file. 

@end table

The general intent of having some @i{streams} be classified as
@i{interactive streams} is to allow them to be distinguished from
streams containing batch (or background or command-file) input.
Output to batch streams is typically discarded or saved for later viewing, 
so interactive queries to such streams might not have the expected effect.

@i{Terminal I/O} might or might not be an @i{interactive stream}.

@subsubsection Abstract Classifications of Streams

@node File Streams, Other Subclasses of Stream, Abstract Classifications of Streams, Introduction to Streams
@subsubsection File Streams

Some @i{streams}, called @i{file streams}
@IGindex file stream
, provide access to @i{files}.
An @i{object} of @i{class} @b{file-stream} is used to represent a @i{file stream}.

The basic operation for opening a @i{file} is @b{open},
which typically returns a @i{file stream} 
(see its dictionary entry for details).
The basic operation for closing a @i{stream} is @b{close}.
The macro @b{with-open-file} is useful 
to express the common idiom of opening a @i{file} 
for the duration of a given body of @i{code}, 
and assuring that the resulting @i{stream} is closed upon exit from that body.

@subsubsection Other Subclasses of Stream

The @i{class} @b{stream} has a number of @i{subclasses} defined 
by this specification.  Figure 21--5 shows some information 
about these subclasses.

@b{broadcast-stream},
@b{stream},
@b{t}

@subsubheading  Description::

A @i{broadcast stream} is an @i{output} @i{stream} which 
has associated with it a set of zero or more @i{output} @i{streams} 
such that any output sent to the @i{broadcast stream} gets passed on
as output to each of the associated @i{output} @i{streams}.
(If a @i{broadcast stream} has no @i{component streams},
then all output to the @i{broadcast stream} is discarded.)

The set of operations that may be performed on a @i{broadcast stream} 
is the intersection of those for its associated @i{output} @i{streams}.

Some output operations (@i{e.g.}, @b{fresh-line}) return @i{values} based on the
state of the @i{stream} at the time of the operation.

Since these @i{values} might differ for each of the @i{component streams},
it is necessary to describe their return value specifically:

@table @asis

@item @t{*}  
@b{stream-element-type} returns
    the value from the last component stream, 
    or @b{t} if there are no component streams.

@item @t{*}  
@b{fresh-line} returns
     the value from the last component stream, 
     or @b{nil} if there are no component streams.

@item @t{*}  
The functions
          @b{file-length},
          @b{file-position},
          @b{file-string-length},
      and @b{stream-external-format}
   return the value from the last component stream;
   if there are no component streams,
       @b{file-length} and @b{file-position} return @t{0},
       @b{file-string-length} returns @t{1},
   and @b{stream-external-format} returns @t{:default}.

@item @t{*}  
The functions @b{streamp} and @b{output-stream-p} 
  always return @i{true} for @i{broadcast streams}.

@item @t{*}  
The functions @b{open-stream-p} tests whether the @i{broadcast stream}
  is @i{open}_2, not whether its component streams are @i{open}.

@item @t{*}  
The functions @b{input-stream-p} and @i{interactive-stream-p} 
  return an @i{implementation-defined}, @i{generalized boolean} value.

@item @t{*}  
For the input operations
        @b{clear-input}
        @b{listen},
        @b{peek-char},
        @b{read-byte},
        @b{read-char-no-hang},
        @b{read-char},
        @b{read-line},
    and @b{unread-char},
  the consequences are undefined if the indicated operation is performed.
  However, an @i{implementation} is permitted 
  to define such a behavior as an @i{implementation-dependent} extension.
@end table

For any output operations not having their return values explicitly specified above
or elsewhere in this document, it is defined that
the @i{values} returned by such an operation are 
the @i{values} resulting from performing the operation 
on the last of its @i{component streams};
the @i{values} resulting from performing the operation
on all preceding @i{streams} are discarded.                    
If there are no @i{component streams}, 
the value is @i{implementation-dependent}.

Input from a @i{concatenated stream} is taken from the first
of the associated @i{input streams} until it reaches @i{end of file}_1; 
then that @i{stream} is discarded, and subsequent input is taken
from the next @i{input stream}, and so on.
An @i{end of file} on the associated @i{input streams} is always managed
invisibly by the @i{concatenated stream}---the only time a client of
a @i{concatenated stream} sees an @i{end of file} is when an attempt is
made to obtain data from the @i{concatenated stream} but it has no
remaining @i{input streams} from which to obtain such data.

@subsubheading  Description::

An @i{echo stream} is a @i{bidirectional} @i{stream}
that gets  its input  from an associated @i{input}  @i{stream}
and  sends its output to   an associated @i{output} @i{stream}.

All input taken from the @i{input} @i{stream} 
is echoed to the @i{output} @i{stream}.
Whether the input is echoed immediately after it is encountered,
or after it has been read from the @i{input stream}
is @i{implementation-dependent}.

@i{recursive-p}---a @i{generalized boolean}.
 The default is @i{false}.

@i{char}---a @i{character} or the @i{eof-value}.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{peek-char} obtains the next character in @i{input-stream}
without actually reading it, thus leaving the character
to be read at a later time.  It can
also be used to skip over and discard intervening
characters in the @i{input-stream} 
until a particular character is found.

If @i{peek-type} is not supplied or @b{nil},
@b{peek-char} returns the next character to be read from 
@i{input-stream}, without actually removing it from 
@i{input-stream}.
The next time input is done from @i{input-stream}, the character will still
be there.  
If @i{peek-type} is @b{t},
then @b{peek-char} skips over @i{whitespace}_2 @i{characters},
but not comments,
and then performs the peeking operation on the next
character.
The last character examined, the one that starts an @i{object},
is not removed from @i{input-stream}.
If @i{peek-type} is a @i{character},
then @b{peek-char} skips
over input characters until a character that
is @b{char=} to that @i{character} is found;          
that character is left in @i{input-stream}.

If an @i{end of file}_2 occurs and @i{eof-error-p} is @i{false},
@i{eof-value} is returned.  

If @i{recursive-p} is @i{true},
this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to @b{read} 
or a similar @i{function} used by the @i{Lisp reader}.

When @i{input-stream} is an @i{echo stream},
characters that are only peeked at are not echoed. In the
case that @i{peek-type} is not @b{nil},
the characters that are passed by @b{peek-char} 
are treated as if by @b{read-char},
and so are echoed unless they have been marked otherwise by @b{unread-char}.

@subsubheading  Arguments and Values::

@i{output-stream} -- an @i{output} @i{stream designator}.
 The default is @i{standard output}.

@i{generalized-boolean}---a @i{generalized boolean}.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{terpri} outputs a @i{newline} to @i{output-stream}.

@b{fresh-line} is similar to @b{terpri} but outputs a @i{newline}
only if the @i{output-stream} is not already at the start of a line.
If for some reason this cannot be determined, then a @i{newline} is output anyway.
@b{fresh-line} returns @i{true} if it outputs a @i{newline};
otherwise it returns @i{false}.

@subsubheading  Arguments and Values::

  must be the last @i{character} that was read from @i{input-stream}.

@i{input-stream}---an @i{input} @i{stream designator}.
 The default is @i{standard input}.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{unread-char} places @i{character} back onto the front of
@i{input-stream} so that it will again be the next character
in @i{input-stream}.

When @i{input-stream} is an @i{echo stream},
no attempt is made to undo any echoing of the character that might already
have been done on @i{input-stream}. However, characters placed on 
@i{input-stream} by @b{unread-char} are marked in such a way 
as to inhibit later re-echo by @b{read-char}.

It is an error to invoke @b{unread-char} 
twice consecutively on the same @i{stream}
without an intervening call to @b{read-char} 
(or some other input operation which implicitly reads characters)
on that @i{stream}.

Invoking @b{peek-char} or @b{read-char} commits all previous characters.
The consequences of invoking @b{unread-char}
on any character preceding that which is returned by 
@b{peek-char} (including those passed over by 
@b{peek-char} that has a @i{non-nil} @i{peek-type})
are unspecified.
In particular, the consequences of 
invoking @b{unread-char} after @b{peek-char}
are unspecified.

@subsubheading  Description::

Reads from @i{input-stream} a line of text
that is terminated by a @i{newline} or @i{end of file}.

If @i{recursive-p} is @i{true},
this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to @b{read} 
or a similar @i{function} used by the @i{Lisp reader}.

The @i{primary value}, @i{line}, is the line that is read,
represented as a @i{string} (without the trailing @i{newline}, if any).
If  @i{eof-error-p} is @i{false} 
and the @i{end of file} for @i{input-stream} is reached
     before any @i{characters} are read,
@i{eof-value} is returned as the @i{line}.

The @i{secondary value}, @i{missing-newline-p}, 
is a @i{generalized boolean} that is
    @i{false} if the @i{line} was terminated by a @i{newline},
 or @i{true}  if the @i{line} was terminated by

@i{Sequence} is destructively modified by copying successive

@i{stream} is reached before copying all @i{elements} of the
subsequence, then the extra @i{elements} near the end of @i{sequence}
are not updated.

@i{Position} is the index of the first @i{element} of @i{sequence}
that was not updated, which might be less than @i{end} because the
@i{end of file} was reached.

@i{position-spec}---a @i{file position designator}.

@i{position}---a @i{file position} or @b{nil}.

@i{success-p}---a @i{generalized boolean}.

@subsubheading  Description::

Returns or changes the current position within a @i{stream}.

When @i{position-spec} is not supplied,
@b{file-position} returns the current @i{file position} in the @i{stream},
or @b{nil} if this cannot be determined.

When @i{position-spec} is supplied,
the @i{file position} in @i{stream} is set to that @i{file position} (if possible).
@b{file-position} returns @i{true} 
if the repositioning is performed successfully,
or @i{false} if it is not.

An @i{integer} returned by @b{file-position} of one argument 
should be acceptable as @i{position-spec} for use with the same file.

For a character file,
performing a single @b{read-char} or @b{write-char} operation
may cause the file position to be increased by more than 1 because of
character-set translations (such as translating between the @r{Common Lisp}
@t{#\Newline} character and an external ASCII
carriage-return/line-feed sequence) and other aspects of the
implementation.  For a binary file, every @b{read-byte} 
or @b{write-byte}
operation increases the file position by 1.

@end example

@subsubheading  Side Effects::

When the @i{position-spec} argument is supplied,
the @i{file position} in the @i{stream} might be moved.

@subsubheading  Affected By::

The value returned by @b{file-position} increases monotonically
as input or output operations are performed.  

@subsubheading  Exceptional Situations::

If @i{position-spec} is supplied, but is too large or otherwise inappropriate, 
an error is signaled.

@subsubheading  Notes::

Implementations that have character files represented
as a sequence of records of bounded size might choose to encode the
file position as, for example,
<<@i{record-number}>>*<<@i{max-record-size}>>+<<@i{character-within-record}>>.
This is a valid encoding because it increases monotonically as
each character is read or written, though not necessarily by 1 at
each step.  An @i{integer} might then be considered ``inappropriate''
as @i{position-spec} to @b{file-position} if, when decoded into
record number and character number, it turned out that the
supplied record was too short for the specified character number.

		      or @i{if-exists} is @t{:overwrite} or @t{:append};
	  @t{:create} if @i{direction} is @t{:output} or @t{:io},
		      and @i{if-exists} is neither @t{:overwrite} nor @t{:append};
       or @b{nil} when @i{direction} is @t{:probe}.

@i{external-format}---an @i{external file format designator}.
  The default is @t{:default}.

@i{stream}---a @i{file stream} or @b{nil}.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{open} creates, opens, and returns a @i{file stream} 
that is connected to the file specified by @i{filespec}.
@i{Filespec} is the name of the file to be opened.  
If the @i{filespec} @i{designator} is a @i{stream},
that @i{stream} is not closed first or otherwise affected.

The keyword arguments to @b{open} specify the characteristics 
of the @i{file stream} that is returned, and how to handle errors.

If @i{direction} is @t{:input}
or @t{:probe},
or if @i{if-exists} is not @t{:new-version}
and the version component of the @i{filespec} is @t{:newest},
then the file opened is that file already existing in the file system
that has a version greater than that of any other file in the file system
whose other pathname components are the same as those of @i{filespec}.

An implementation is required to recognize all of 
the @b{open} keyword options 
and to do something reasonable in the context of the host operating
system.  
For example, if a file system does not support distinct file
versions and does not distinguish the notions of deletion and expunging,
@t{:new-version} might be treated the same as
@t{:rename} or @t{:supersede}, and @t{:rename-and-delete} might
be treated the same as @t{:supersede}.

@table @asis

@item @t{:direction}  
These are the possible values for @i{direction}, 
and how they affect the nature of the @i{stream} that is created:

@table @asis

@item @t{:input}  
Causes the creation of an @i{input} @i{file stream}.

@item @t{:output}  
Causes the creation of an @i{output} @i{file stream}.

@item @t{:io}  
Causes the creation of a @i{bidirectional} @i{file stream}.

@item @t{:probe}  
Causes the creation of a ``no-directional'' @i{file stream}; 
in effect, the @i{file stream} is created 
and then closed prior to being returned by @b{open}.

@end table

@item @t{:element-type}  
The @i{element-type} specifies the unit of transaction for the @i{file stream}.
If it is @t{:default},
the unit is determined by @i{file system},
possibly based on the @i{file}.

@item @t{:if-exists}  
@i{if-exists} specifies the action to be taken if @i{direction} is
@t{:output} or @t{:io} and a file of the name @i{filespec} 
already exists.
If @i{direction} is @t{:input}, not supplied, or @t{:probe}, 
@i{if-exists} is ignored.
These are the results of @b{open} as modified by @i{if-exists}:

@table @asis

@item @t{:error}  
An error of @i{type} @b{file-error} is signaled.

@item @t{:new-version}  
A new file is created with a larger version number.

@item @t{:rename}  
The existing file is renamed to some other name and then a new file is created.

@item @t{:rename-and-delete}  
The existing file is renamed to some other name,
then it is deleted but not expunged, and then a new file is created.

@item @t{:overwrite}  
Output operations on the @i{stream} destructively modify the existing file.
If @i{direction} is @t{:io} the file is opened in a bidirectional mode
that allows both reading and writing.  The file pointer is initially 
positioned at the beginning of the file; however, the file is not truncated
back to length zero when it is opened.

@item @t{:append}  
Output operations on the @i{stream} destructively modify the existing file.
The file pointer is initially positioned at the end of the file.

If @i{direction} is @t{:io},
the file is opened in a bidirectional mode that allows both reading and writing.

@item @t{:supersede}  
The existing file is superseded;
that is, a new file with the same name as the old one is created.
If possible, the implementation should not destroy the old file until the new
@i{stream} is closed.

@item @b{nil}  
No file or @i{stream} is created;
instead, @b{nil} is returned to indicate failure.

@end table

@item @t{:if-does-not-exist}  
@i{if-does-not-exist}
specifies the action to be taken if
a file of name @i{filespec} does not already exist.
These are the results of @b{open} as modified by @i{if-does-not-exist}:

@table @asis

@item @t{:error}  
An error of @i{type} @b{file-error} is signaled.

@item @t{:create}  
An empty file is created.
Processing continues  as if the file 
had already existed but no processing as 
directed by @i{if-exists} is performed.

@item @b{nil}  
No file or @i{stream} is created;
instead, @b{nil} is returned to indicate failure.

@end table

@item @t{:external-format}  
This option selects an @i{external file format} for the @i{file}:
The only @i{standardized} value for this option is @t{:default},
although @i{implementations} are permitted to define additional 
@i{external file formats} and @i{implementation-dependent} values 
returned by @b{stream-external-format} can also be used by @i{conforming programs}.

The @i{external-format} is meaningful for
any kind of @i{file stream} whose @i{element type}
is a @i{subtype} of @i{character}.
This option is ignored for @i{streams} for which it is not meaningful;
however, @i{implementations} may define other @i{element types} 
for which it is meaningful.
The consequences are unspecified if a @i{character} is written 
that cannot be represented by the given @i{external file format}.

@end table

When a file is opened, a @i{file stream} is constructed to serve
as the file system's ambassador to the @r{Lisp} environment;
operations on the @i{file stream} are reflected by operations on the file
in the file system.  

A file can be deleted, renamed, or destructively modified by @b{open}.

For information about opening relative pathnames,
see @ref{Merging Pathnames}.

@subsubheading  Examples::

 (open @i{filespec} :direction :probe)  @result{}  #<Closed Probe File Stream...>
 (setq q (merge-pathnames (user-homedir-pathname) "test"))
@result{}  #<PATHNAME :HOST NIL :DEVICE @i{device-name} :DIRECTORY @i{directory-name}

@subsubheading  Affected By::

The nature and state of the host computer's @i{file system}.

@subsubheading  Exceptional Situations::                        

If @i{if-exists} is @t{:error}, (subject to the
constraints on the meaning of @i{if-exists} listed above),
an error of @i{type} @b{file-error} is signaled.                        

If @i{if-does-not-exist} is @t{:error} (subject to the
constraints on the meaning of @i{if-does-not-exist} listed above),
an error of @i{type} @b{file-error} is signaled.

If it is impossible for an implementation to handle some option
in a manner close to what is specified here,
an error of @i{type} @b{error} might be signaled.

An error of @i{type} @b{file-error} is signaled if
@t{(wild-pathname-p @i{filespec})} returns true.

An error of @i{type} @b{error} is signaled if the @i{external-format} 
is not understood by the @i{implementation}.

The various @i{file systems} in existence today have widely differing capabilities,
and some aspects of the @i{file system} are beyond the scope of this specification
to define.  A given @i{implementation} might not be able to support all of these options 
in exactly the manner stated.  An @i{implementation} is required to recognize all of 
these option keywords and to try to do something ``reasonable'' in the context of the 
host @i{file system}.  Where necessary to accommodate the @i{file system},
an @i{implementation} deviate slightly from the semantics specified here without 
being disqualified for consideration as a @i{conforming implementation}.
If it is utterly impossible for an @i{implementation} to handle some option
in a manner similar to what is specified here, it may simply signal an error.

With regard to the @t{:element-type} option, if a @i{type} is
requested that is not supported by the @i{file system}, a substitution of types 
such as that which goes on in @i{upgrading} is permissible.  As a minimum 
requirement, it should be the case that opening an @i{output} @i{stream}
to a @i{file} in a given @i{element type} and later opening 
an @i{input} @i{stream} to the same @i{file} in the same @i{element type}
should work compatibly.

@b{open} does not automatically close the file when an abnormal
exit occurs.

When @i{element-type} is a @i{subtype} of @b{character},
@b{read-char} and/or @b{write-char} can be
used on the resulting @i{file stream}. 

When @i{element-type} is a @i{subtype} of @i{integer},

When @i{element-type} is @t{:default},

@subsubheading  Syntax::

@code{with-open-file}  @i{@r{(}stream filespec @{@i{options}@}*@r{)}
		   @{@i{declaration}@}*
		   @{@i{form}@}*}@*
   @result{}  @i{results}

@subsubheading  Arguments and Values::

@i{stream} -- a variable.

@i{filespec}---a @i{pathname designator}.

@i{options} -- @i{forms}; evaluated.

@i{declaration}---a @b{declare} @i{expression}; not evaluated.

@i{forms}---an @i{implicit progn}.

@i{results}---the @i{values} returned by the @i{forms}.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{with-open-file} uses @b{open} to create a @i{file stream}

to @i{file} named by @i{filespec}. 
@i{Filespec} is the name of the file to be opened.
@i{Options} are used as keyword arguments to @b{open}.

The @i{stream} @i{object} to which the @i{stream} @i{variable} 
is @i{bound} has @i{dynamic extent};
its @i{extent} ends when the @i{form} is exited.

@b{with-open-file} evaluates the @i{forms} as an @i{implicit progn} 
with @i{stream} bound to 

the value returned by @b{open}.

When control leaves the body, either normally or abnormally (such as by
use of @b{throw}), the file is automatically closed.  If a new
output file is being written, and control leaves abnormally, the file is
aborted and the file system is left, so far as possible, as if the file
had never been opened.  

It is possible by the use of @t{:if-exists nil} 
or @t{:if-does-not-exist nil} for
@i{stream} to be bound to @b{nil}.

Users of @t{:if-does-not-exist nil} should check for a valid @i{stream}.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to @i{assign} the 
@i{stream} @i{variable}.  The compiler may choose to issue a
warning if such an attempt is detected.

@subsubheading  Examples::

@example
 (setq p (merge-pathnames "test"))
@result{}  #<PATHNAME :HOST NIL :DEVICE @i{device-name} :DIRECTORY @i{directory-name}
    :NAME "test" :TYPE NIL :VERSION :NEWEST>
 (with-open-file (s p :direction :output :if-exists :supersede)
    (format s "Here are a couple~
 (with-open-file (s p)
    (do ((l (read-line s) (read-line s nil 'eof)))
        ((eq l 'eof) "Reached end of file.")
     (format t "~&*** ~A~
@t{ |> } *** Here are a couple
@t{ |> } *** of test data lines
@result{}  "Reached end of file."
@end example

@example
;; Normally one would not do this intentionally because it is
;; not perspicuous, but beware when using :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL
;; that this doesn't happen to you accidentally...
 (with-open-file (foo "no-such-file" :if-does-not-exist nil)
   (read foo))
@t{ |> } @b{|>>}@t{hello?}@b{<<|}
@result{}  HELLO? ;This value was read from the terminal, not a file!

;; Here's another bug to avoid...
 (with-open-file (foo "no-such-file" :direction :output :if-does-not-exist nil)
   (format foo "Hello"))
@result{}  "Hello" ;FORMAT got an argument of NIL!
@end example

@subsubheading  Side Effects::

Creates a @i{stream} to the @i{file} named by @i{filename} (upon entry),
and closes the @i{stream} (upon exit).
In some @i{implementations},
the @i{file} might be locked in some way while it is open.
If the @i{stream} is an @i{output} @i{stream},
a @i{file} might be created.

@code{close}  @i{stream @r{&key} abort} @result{}  @i{result}

@subsubheading  Arguments and Values::

@i{stream}---a @i{stream} (either @i{open} or @i{closed}).

@i{abort}---a @i{generalized boolean}.
 The default is @i{false}.

@i{result}---@b{t} if the @i{stream} was @i{open} at the time it was
		     received as an @i{argument},
		 or @i{implementation-dependent} otherwise.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{close} closes @i{stream}. 
Closing a @i{stream} means
that it may no longer be used in input or output operations.
The act of @i{closing} a @i{file stream}
ends the association between the @i{stream} and its associated @i{file}; 
the transaction with the @i{file system} is terminated,
and input/output may no longer be performed on the @i{stream}. 

If @i{abort} is @i{true}, an attempt is made to clean up any side
effects of having created @i{stream}.
If @i{stream} performs output to a file
that was created when the @i{stream} was created, the
file is deleted and any previously existing file is not superseded.

It is permissible to close an already closed @i{stream},
but in that case the @i{result} is @i{implementation-dependent}.

After @i{stream} is closed, it is still possible to perform 
the following query operations upon it:

@b{streamp}, @b{pathname}, @b{truename}, 
@b{merge-pathnames}, @b{pathname-host}, @b{pathname-device},
@b{pathname-directory},@b{pathname-name}, 
@b{pathname-type}, @b{pathname-version}, @b{namestring}, 
@b{file-namestring}, @b{directory-namestring}, 
@b{host-namestring}, @b{enough-namestring}, @b{open},
@b{probe-file}, and @b{directory}. 

The effect of @b{close} on a @i{constructed stream} is 
 to close the argument @i{stream} only. 
There is no effect on the @i{constituents} of @i{composite streams}.

For a @i{stream} created with @b{make-string-output-stream},
the result of @b{get-output-stream-string} is unspecified after @b{close}.

@subsubheading  Examples::

@example
 (setq s (make-broadcast-stream)) @result{}  #<BROADCAST-STREAM>
 (close s) @result{}  T
 (output-stream-p s) @result{}  @i{true}
@end example

@subsubheading  Side Effects::

The @i{stream} is @i{closed} (if necessary).
If @i{abort} is @i{true} and the @i{stream} is
an @i{output} @i{file stream}, its associated @i{file}
might be deleted.

@i{Var} is bound to the value of @i{stream},
and then @i{forms} are executed
as an @i{implicit progn}. 
@i{stream}
is automatically closed on exit from @b{with-open-stream},
no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.

The @i{stream} has @i{dynamic extent};
its @i{extent} ends when the @i{form} is exited.

@b{clear-output} attempts to abort any

@i{arguments}---@i{format arguments} for @i{control}.

@i{generalized-boolean}---a @i{generalized boolean}.

@subsubheading  Description::

These functions ask a question and parse a response from the user.
They return @i{true} if the answer is affirmative,
or @i{false} if the answer is negative.

@b{y-or-n-p} is for asking the user a question whose answer is either
``yes'' or ``no.''  
It is intended that the reply require
the user to answer a yes-or-no question with a single
character.
@b{yes-or-no-p} is also for asking the user a question
whose answer is either ``Yes'' or ``No.''  
It is intended that the reply require
the user to take more action than just a single keystroke, such as typing
the full word @t{yes} or @t{no} followed by a newline.

@b{y-or-n-p} types out a message (if supplied), reads an answer
in some @i{implementation-dependent} manner (intended to be short and simple,
such as reading a single character such as @t{Y} or @t{N}).
@b{yes-or-no-p} types out a message (if supplied), 
attracts the user's attention (for example, by ringing
the terminal's bell),
and reads an answer
in some @i{implementation-dependent} manner (intended to be multiple characters,
such as @t{YES} or @t{NO}).

If @i{format-control} is supplied and not @b{nil},
then a @b{fresh-line} operation is performed; then
a message is printed as if @i{format-control} and @i{arguments}
were given to @b{format}.
In any case, @b{yes-or-no-p} and @b{y-or-n-p} will provide 
a prompt such as ``@t{(Y or N)}'' or ``@t{(Yes or No)}'' if appropriate.

All input and output are performed using @i{query I/O}.

@subsubheading  Examples::
@example
 (y-or-n-p "(t or nil) given by")
@t{ |> } (t or nil) given by (Y or N) @b{|>>}@t{Y}@b{<<|}
@result{}  @i{true}
 (yes-or-no-p "a ~S message" 'frightening) 
@t{ |> } a FRIGHTENING message (Yes or No) @b{|>>}@t{no}@b{<<|}
@result{}  @i{false}
 (y-or-n-p "Produce listing file?") 
@t{ |> } Produce listing file?
@t{ |> } Please respond with Y or N. @b{|>>}@t{n}@b{<<|}
@result{}  @i{false}
@end example

@subsubheading  Side Effects::

Output to and input from @i{query I/O} will occur.

@subsubheading  Notes::

@b{yes-or-no-p} and @b{yes-or-no-p} do not add question marks
to the end of the prompt string, so any desired question mark or other
punctuation should be explicitly included in the text query.

@i{forms}---an @i{implicit progn}.

@i{result}---the @i{values} returned by the @i{forms}.

@subsubheading  Description::

Creates an

@i{input} @i{string stream}, 

provides an opportunity to perform operations on the @i{stream} 
 (returning zero or more @i{values}),
and then closes the @i{string stream}.

@i{String} is evaluated first, and @i{var} is bound to
a character @i{input} @i{string stream} that supplies 
@i{characters} from the subsequence of the resulting @i{string} @i{bounded} by
@i{start} and @i{end}. 
The body is executed as an @i{implicit progn}.

The @i{input} @i{string stream} is automatically closed on exit from
@b{with-input-from-string}, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.

The @i{input} @i{string stream} to which the @i{variable} @i{var}
is @i{bound} has @i{dynamic extent};
its @i{extent} ends when the @i{form} is exited.

The @i{index} is a pointer within the @i{string} to be advanced.
If @b{with-input-from-string}
is exited normally, then @i{index} will have
as its @i{value}
the index into the @i{string} indicating the first character not read
which is @t{(length @i{string})} if all characters were used.
The place specified by @i{index}
is not updated as reading progresses, but only at the
end of the operation. 

@i{start} and @i{index} may both specify the same variable, 
which is a pointer within the @i{string} to be advanced,
perhaps repeatedly by some containing loop.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to @i{assign} 
the @i{variable} @i{var}.

@subsubheading  Examples::
@example
 (with-input-from-string (s "XXX1 2 3 4xxx"

                             :start 3 :end 10)

 (with-input-from-string (s "Animal Crackers" :index j :start 6)
   (read s)) @result{}  CRACKERS
@end example

The variable @t{j} is set to @t{15}.

@subsubheading  Description::

@b{with-output-to-string} creates a

character @i{output} @i{stream}, performs a series of operations
that may send results to this @i{stream}, and then closes the @i{stream}. 

The @i{element-type} names the @i{type} of the elements
of the @i{stream}; a @i{stream} is constructed of the most specialized
@i{type} that can accommodate elements of the given @i{type}.  

The body is executed as an @i{implicit progn} with @i{var}
bound to an @i{output} @i{string stream}.  
All output to that @i{string stream} is saved in a @i{string}.  

If @i{string} is supplied, @i{element-type} is ignored, 
and the output is incrementally appended to @i{string} as
if by use of @b{vector-push-extend}.

The @i{output} @i{stream} 
is automatically closed on exit from @b{with-output-from-string},
no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.

The @i{output} @i{string stream} to which the @i{variable} @i{var}
is @i{bound} has @i{dynamic extent};
its @i{extent} ends when the @i{form} is exited.

If no @i{string} is provided, then @b{with-output-from-string} 

produces a @i{stream} that accepts characters and returns a @i{string} 
of the indicated @i{element-type}.

If @i{string} is provided,
@b{with-output-to-string} returns the results of evaluating the last @i{form}.

The consequences are undefined if an attempt is made to @i{assign}
the @i{variable} @i{var}.

@subsubheading  Examples::
@example
 (setq fstr (make-array '(0) :element-type 'base-char
                             :fill-pointer 0 :adjustable t)) @result{}  ""
 (with-output-to-string (s fstr)
    (format s "here's some output")
    (input-stream-p s)) @result{}  @i{false}
 fstr @result{}  "here's some output"
@end example

@subsubheading  Side Effects::

The @i{string} is modified.

@subsubheading  Exceptional Situations::

The consequences are undefined if destructive modifications are performed
directly on the @i{string} during the @i{dynamic extent} of the call.

@subsubheading  Value Type::

For @b{*standard-input*}:
 an @i{input} @i{stream}

For @b{*error-output*}, @b{*standard-output*}, and @b{*trace-output*}:
 an @i{output} @i{stream}.

For @b{*debug-io*}, @b{*query-io*}:
 a @i{bidirectional} @i{stream}.

@subsubheading  Initial Value::

@i{implementation-dependent}, but
it must be an @i{open} @i{stream} 
that is not a  @i{generalized synonym stream}
to an @i{I/O customization variables}
but that might be a @i{generalized synonym stream} to 
the value of some @i{I/O customization variable}.
The initial value might also be a @i{generalized synonym stream} 
to either the @i{symbol} @b{*terminal-io*} or to the @i{stream} 
that is its @i{value}.

@subsubheading  Description::

These @i{variables} are collectively called the
@i{standardized} @i{I/O customization variables}.
They can be @i{bound} or @i{assigned} in order to 
change the default destinations for input and/or output 
used by various @i{standardized} @i{operators} and facilities.

The @i{value} of @b{*debug-io*}, called @i{debug I/O},
is a @i{stream} to be used for interactive debugging purposes.  

The @i{value} of @b{*error-output*}, called @i{error output},
is a @i{stream} to which warnings and non-interactive error messages should be sent.

The @i{value} of @b{*query-io*}, called @i{query I/O},
is a @i{bidirectional} @i{stream} 
to be used when asking questions of the user.  The question should be output 
to this @i{stream}, and the answer read from it.

The @i{value} of @b{*standard-input*}, called @i{standard input},
is a @i{stream} that is used by many @i{operators} 
as a default source of input when no specific @i{input} @i{stream}
is explicitly supplied.

The @i{value} of @b{*standard-output*}, called @i{standard output},
is a @i{stream} that is used by many @i{operators} 
as a default destination for output when no specific @i{output} @i{stream}
is explicitly supplied.

The @i{value} of @b{*trace-output*}, called @i{trace output},
is the @i{stream} on which traced functions (see @b{trace})
and the @b{time} @i{macro} print their output.

@subsubheading  Examples::

@example
 (with-output-to-string (*error-output*)
   (warn "this string is sent to *error-output*"))
 @result{}  "Warning: this string is sent to *error-output*
" ;The exact format of this string is @i{implementation-dependent}.

 (with-input-from-string (*standard-input* "1001")
    (+ 990 (read))) @result{}  1991                       

 (progn (setq out (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)
                     (print "print and format t send things to")
                     (format t "*standard-output* now going to a string")))
        :done)
@result{}  :DONE
 out
@result{}  "
\"print and format t send things to\" *standard-output* now going to a string"

 (defun fact (n) (if (< n 2) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
@result{}  FACT
 (trace fact)
@result{}  (FACT)
;; Of course, the format of traced output is implementation-dependent.
 (with-output-to-string (*trace-output*)
   (fact 3)) 
@result{}  "
1 Enter FACT 3
| 2 Enter FACT 2
|   3 Enter FACT 1
|   3 Exit FACT 1
| 2 Exit FACT 2
1 Exit FACT 6"

@subsubheading  Notes::

The intent of the constraints on the initial @i{value} 
of the @i{I/O customization variables} is to ensure that it
is always safe to @i{bind} or @i{assign} such a @i{variable} to 
the @i{value} of another @i{I/O customization variable}, without
unduly restricting @i{implementation} flexibility.

It is common for an @i{implementation} to make
the initial @i{values} of @b{*debug-io*} and @b{*query-io*} 
be the @i{same} @i{stream}, 
and to make
the initial @i{values} of @b{*error-output*} and @b{*standard-output*} 
be the @i{same} @i{stream}.

The functions @b{y-or-n-p} and @b{yes-or-no-p} use @i{query I/O}
for their input and output.

In the normal @i{Lisp read-eval-print loop},
input is read from @i{standard input}.
Many input functions, including @b{read} and @b{read-char},
take a @i{stream} argument that defaults to @i{standard input}.

In the normal @i{Lisp read-eval-print loop}, output is sent to @i{standard output}.
Many output functions, including @b{print} and @b{write-char}, 
take a @i{stream} argument that defaults to @i{standard output}.

A program that wants, for example, to divert output to a file should do so by 
@i{binding} @b{*standard-output*}; that way error messages sent to
@b{*error-output*} can still get to the user by going through
@b{*terminal-io*} (if @b{*error-output*} is bound to @b{*terminal-io*}),
which is usually what is desired.

@subsection *terminal-io*                                                    [Variable]

@subsubheading  Value Type::

a @i{bidirectional} @i{stream}.

@subsubheading  Initial Value::

@i{implementation-dependent}, but
it must be an @i{open} @i{stream} 
that is not a  @i{generalized synonym stream}
to an @i{I/O customization variables}
but that might be a @i{generalized synonym stream} to 
the @i{value} of some @i{I/O customization variable}.

@subsubheading  Description::

The @i{value} of @b{*terminal-io*}, called  @i{terminal I/O}, is ordinarily 
a @i{bidirectional} @i{stream} that connects to the user's console.
Typically, writing to this @i{stream} 
would cause the output to appear
on a display screen, for example, and reading from the @i{stream} would
accept input from a keyboard.  It is intended
that standard input functions such as @b{read} and @b{read-char},
when used with this @i{stream}, cause echoing of the input
into the output side of the @i{stream}. The means by which this is
accomplished are @i{implementation-dependent}.

The effect of changing the @i{value} of @b{*terminal-io*},
either by @i{binding} or @i{assignment},
is @i{implementation-defined}.

@subsubheading  Examples::

@example
 (progn (prin1 'foo) (prin1 'bar *terminal-io*))
@t{ |> } FOOBAR
@result{}  BAR
 (with-output-to-string (*standard-output*)
   (prin1 'foo) 
   (prin1 'bar *terminal-io*))
@t{ |> } BAR
@result{}  "FOO"
