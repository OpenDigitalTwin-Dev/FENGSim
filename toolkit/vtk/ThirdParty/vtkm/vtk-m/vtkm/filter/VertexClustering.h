/// \brief Reduce the number of triangles in a mesh
///
/// VertexClustering is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a
/// triangle mesh, forming a good approximation to the original geometry. The
/// input must be a dataset that only contains triangles.
///
/// The general approach of the algorithm is to cluster vertices in a uniform
/// binning of space, accumulating to an average point within each bin. In
/// more detail, the algorithm first gets the bounds of the input poly data.
/// It then breaks this bounding volume into a user-specified number of
/// spatial bins.  It then reads each triangle from the input and hashes its
/// vertices into these bins. Then, if 2 or more vertices of
/// the triangle fall in the same bin, the triangle is dicarded.  If the
/// triangle is not discarded, it adds the triangle to the list of output
/// triangles as a list of vertex identifiers.  (There is one vertex id per
/// bin.)  After all the triangles have been read, the representative vertex
/// for each bin is computed.  This determines the spatial location of the
/// vertices of each of the triangles in the output.
///
/// To use this filter, specify the divisions defining the spatial subdivision
/// in the x, y, and z directions. Compared to algorithms such as
/// vtkQuadricClustering, a significantly higher bin count is recommended as it
/// doesn't increase the computation or memory of the algorithm and will produce
/// significantly better results.
///
/// @warning
/// This filter currently doesn't propagate cell or point fields
