I. FASP and SuiteSparse
================================

I.1. How to install FASP with minimal UMFPACK installation?

To compile and link (correctly) the FASP sources and libraries with
the UMFPACK direct solver libraries (part of the SuiteSparse package),
and, without installing the complete SuiteSparse package, the
SuiteSparse configuration/installation should be changed as follows:

I.1.a In the configuration file
      SuiteSparse_config/SuiteSparse_config.mk: On a MAC OS X machine
      remove "-lrt" from "LIB = -lm -lrt" and add to the definition of
      the variable “CF” "-DNTIMER", by writing "CF += -DNTIMER" after
      the definition of "CF".

I.1.b Check that you have "UMFPACK_CONFIG = -DNCHOLMOD” (to compile
      and install the UMFPACK library without CHOLMOD).

I.1.c In the same file you can also set INSTALL_LIB and
      INSTALL_INCLUDE directories.

I.1.d "cd AMD ; make ;  make install"

I.I.e "cd SuiteSparse_config ; make ;  make install"

I.I.f "cd UMFPACK ; make ; make install"

--------------------------------

I.2. How to change the FASP (faspsolver) Makefile to use a system-wise
     UMFPACK installation?

I.2.a If you have installed the UMFPACK libraries in a "standard"
      location, such as "/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" or
      other such standard locations then in the Makefile of the
      faspsolver just uncomment "umfpack = yes".

I.2.b If you have installed the libraries and the header files in a
      custom location, say "INSTALL_DIR_SUITESPARSE" then, in addition
      to the action in 2a. in the faspsolver Makefile write

      	 suitesparsedir=INSTALL_DIR_SUITESPARSE

      The subdirectories "INSTALL_DIR_SUITESPARSE/include" and
      "INSTALL_DIR_SUITESPARSE/lib" must contain the SuiteSparse
      header and library files so that the faspsolver configuration
      script can locate them.

II. FASP and FEniCS
================================

II.1. How to install FASP when FEniCS-1.5.0 configuration file is loaded?

II.1.a Problem: When FEniCS (at least 1.5.0 version is installed) and
       fenics.conf file is loaded, some versions of gfortran do not
       work properly which causes the configuration of FASP to
       crash.

II.1.b The cause of the problem is that FEniCS does not have
       the latest libraries "libgmp**" in their directory and the
       fenics.conf file sets the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       environmental variable so that the directory with the FEniCS
       custom libraries is searched by compiler/linker first.

II.1.c Solution: Back up the libgmp library that ships with FEniCS (on
       MAC OS X these files are:
       "/Applications/FEniCS.app/Contents/Resources/lib/libgmp*"
       Download the source of the latest release for the GNU Multiple
       Precision Arithmetic Library (a.k.a. GMP) and install it in
       place of the FEniCS ones. After this the gfortran compilers
       work properly and FASP will configure with no problem.

II.1.d There is another way to fix this problem. You can edit the 
       FEniCS conf file by replacing "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" with 
       "DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH". The conf file is located at
       "FEniCS.app/Contents/Resources/share/fenics/fenics.conf".

--------------------------------

II.2. I use GCC on my Mac OS X. Why "make config" gives warnings like
      "** WARNING: CC and FC mismatch. ..."?

This is due to FEniCS conf sets CC to /usr/bin/gcc. By default, this
is an Apple clang compiler. There is no corresponding Fortran compiler
for clang. This is the reason why config complains. You can either:

II.2.a Ignore the warning and continue with building and installing.

II.2.b Add CC=/dir/to/gcc in your FASP.mk to tell the config where is
       your GNU C compiler installed. 

II.2.c Use "make config CC=/dir/to/gcc" to tell the config where is
       your GNU C compiler installed.
