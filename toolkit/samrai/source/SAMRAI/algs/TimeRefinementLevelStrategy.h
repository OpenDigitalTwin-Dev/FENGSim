 * needed by the hierarchy integration class TimeRefinementIntegrator.
 * In particular, this class insulates the hierarchy integrator from the
 * routines that manipulate data on the hierarchy levels in a problem-specific
 * fashion.  When the AMR hierarchy integration and regridding sequence
 * provided by the class TimeRefinementIntegrator are appropriate
 * for some computational problem, a subclass of this base class can be
 * used to provide the necessary operations to the hierarchy integrator.
 * That is, a TimeRefinementIntegrator object may be configured with
 * a concrete implementation of this base class by passing the concrete
 * object into the to the time refinement integrator constructor.

    * the timestep sequence refers to the steps taken to advance the solution
    * through the time interval of the most recent advance on the next coarser
    * level, if such a level exists.  The boolean regrid_advance is false
    * when the advance is part of the actual hierarchy integration process
    * and true when the advance is called during time-dependent regridding
    * (e.g., when using Richardson extrapolation).  The default value is false.
    * The last boolean argument is true when the level is in the hierarchy,
    * and false otherwise.  The default value is true.  Usually, this value
    * is false only during time-dependent regridding operations performed
    * on some temporary level; thus, a schedule must be generated for the
    * level before the advance can occur, for example.
    *
    * When this function is called, the level data required to begin the
    * advance must be allocated and be defined appropriately.  Typically,

    * regridding.  Upon exiting this routine, both current and new data may
    * exist on the level.  This data is needed until level synchronization
    * occurs, in general. Current and new data may be reset by calling
    * the member function resetTimeDependentData().
    *
    * This routine is called from two different points within the
    * TimeRefinementIntegrator class: during the regular time
    * advance sequence, and at the initial simulation time.  The second
    * call is made to advance the solution on a coarser level ahead in time to
    * provide time-dependent boundary values for some finer level when
    * time-dependent regridding is used.  In the first case, the values of
    * the boolean flags are:
    *
    *
    *
    *    - \b  first_step
    *        = true for first step in level time step sequence; else, false.

    *    - \b  regrid_advance
    *        = false.
    *
    *
    *
    * In the second case, the values of the boolean flags are:
    *
    *
    *
    *    - \b  first_step
    *        = true.
