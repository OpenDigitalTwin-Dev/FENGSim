/*!
 * @brief Class RefineSchedule performs the communication
 * operations that refine data to, copy data to, or fill physical boundary
 * data on a destination patch level.
 *
 * Source data is copied into the provided scratch space for temporary
 * processing.  The scratch space must contain sufficient ghost
 * cells to accommodate the stencil width of the given interpolation operators
 * and any physical boundary data that must be filled.  The scratch data
 * is copied into the destination space at the end of the process.
 * The communication schedule is executed by calling member function fillData().
 *
 * Each schedule object is typically created by a refine algorithm and
 * represents the communication dependencies for a particular configuration
 * of the AMR hierarchy.  The communication schedule is only valid for that
 * particular configuration and must be regenerated when the AMR patch
 * hierarchy changes.  However, as long as the patch levels involved in
 * the creation of the schedule remain unchanged, the schedule may be used
 * for multiple communication cycles.  For more information about creating
 * refine schedules, see the RefineAlgorithm header file.
 *
 * Some constructors accept the argument @c dst_level_fill_pattern.  This
 * is a PatchLevelFillPattern which controls which types of cells are filled
 * and which are omitted from the filling process.  Concrete implementations
 * of PatchLevelFillPattern are:
 * - @c PatchLevelFullFillPattern - Fill interior and ghost cells.
 * - @c PatchLevelInteriorFillPattern - Fill interior cells only.
 * - @c PatchLevelBorderFillPattern - Fill ghosts on level borders only.
 * - @c PatchLevelBorderAndInteriorFillPattern - Fill interior and
 *      ghosts on level borders.
