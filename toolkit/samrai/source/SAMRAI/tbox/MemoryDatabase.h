/**
 * Class MemoryDatabase stores (key,value) pairs in a hierarchical
 * database.  Each value may be another database, boolean, box, character,
 * complex, double, float, integer, or string.  Note that boxes are stored
 * using the toolbox box class that can store boxes of any dimension in the
 * same data structure.
 *
 * See the Database class documentation for a description of the
 * generic database interface.
 *
 * The memory database is used for storing input (a "deck") in memory; the
 * derived class InputDatabase use for this purpose; InputDatabase is
 * kept around for historical reasons and the name is a bit more clear
 * than "memory" database but this class is very generic.  The Parser
 * is really the class that process the input; it parses the input file
 * into a database.
 *
 * Note that the memory database will attempt to promote numerical types
 * where appropriate.  The promotion chain is int -> float -> double ->
 * complex.  For example, an integer key will be promoted to a complex
 * value if isComplex() or getComplex() is called.  Double values will also
 * be truncated to floats (with loss of information) if a float call is
 * made on a double value.
 *
 * It is assumed that all processors will access the database in the same
 * manner.  Thus, all error messages are output to pout instead of perr.
