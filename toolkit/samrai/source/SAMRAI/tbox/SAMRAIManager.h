/*!
 * @brief Utility for managing startup and shutdown of SAMRAI objects
 * and for managing the maximum number of patch data components allowed.
 *
 * The startup/shutdown mechanism in SAMRAIManager is used to manage the
 * allocation and deallocation of certain memory, particularly static data
 * that must exist during the full extent of a run or for the full extent
 * of a single problem within a run.  The specific data that is controlled
 * by this mechanism is managed using the StartupShutdownManager.
 *
 * The four steps of the startup/shutdown mechanism are:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> initialize -- called at the start of a program after MPI is
 *      initialized but befor any other SAMRAI objects are used.
 * <li> startup -- called to begin a problem-specific segment of the code.
 * <li> shutdown -- called at the end of a problem-specific segment of the
 *                  code.  Shuts down and deallocates everything that was
 *                  started and allocated by startup.
 * <li> finalize -- called at the end of a program right before MPI is
 *                  finalized.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The startup and shutdown functions may be called multiple times within a
 * run, in order to allow for the execution of more than one problem within one
 * program.  Initialize and finalize must be called exactly once in a single
 * run.
 *
 * Additionally this class manages static data that controls the maximum
 * number of patch data components that can be allowed.
