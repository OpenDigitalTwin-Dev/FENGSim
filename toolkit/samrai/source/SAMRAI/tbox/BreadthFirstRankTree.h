 *
 * The degree of the tree (max number of children at each node) can be
 * set using setTreeDegree(), but that must be done before the tree is
 * set up.  The default is a binary tree (two children).
 *
 * A property of the tree is that the first rank, i0, is always the
 * root.  It is a d-degree tree.  The children of rank i are rank
 * d*(i-i0) and d*(i-i0)+1.  It's parent is rank (i-i0-1)/d.  The tree
 * is as balanced as possible.  Node ranks are close to their siblings
 * but not their parents.  This arangement does not map well to any
 * known communication networks, so this tree does not perform well.
 * It is included for comparison.
