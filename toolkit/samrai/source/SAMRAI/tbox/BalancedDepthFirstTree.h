 * @brief Implementation of RankTreeStrategy aranging ranks in a

 *                    / \
 *                   /   \

 *
 * The tree is as balanced as possible.  Nodes that are close together
 * in the tree tends to be close together in natural ordering.  Without
 * knowing about the underlying message passing network structure, we
 * assume that close natural ordering usually means close together on
 * the network.  Thus nodes close together in the tree are also close
 * together on the network.  Thus, communication between nearest
 * neighbors in the tree tend to be faster.
 *
 * The tree formed by this class has the property that each and every
 * subtree is composed nodes with contiguous natural ordering.  This
 * again benefits communication.
