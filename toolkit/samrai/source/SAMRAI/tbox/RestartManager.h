/**
 * Class RestartManager coordinates SAMRAI restart files (currently
 * implemented using the HDF database class) and the objects comprising
 * SAMRAI-based application code.  The manager class orchestrates opening
 * and closing the database, stores data to be written out for restart,
 * and writes out the restart data to the database.  Note that the restart
 * manager is a Singleton class that acts as a single point of control
 * for restart capabilities.  As such its constructor and destructor are
 * protected members; they are not to be called outside of this class.
 *
 * The general procedure for starting a simulation from a restart file
 * is as follows.
 *
 *
 * \li Open the restart file using openRestartFile("filename").
 * \li Get root of restart database using getRootDatabase().
 * \li Initialize simulation objects using the restart constructor
 *       for the objects.
 * \li Close the restart file using closeRestartFile().
 *
 * Technically, there is no need to close the restart file because this will
 * automatically be taken care of by the destructor for the database object.
 *
 * It is important to note in the initialization process, some objects
 * will need to be constructed in the "empty" state and filled in later
 * using some sort of getFromRestart() method.
 *
 * The process for writing out state to a restart file is somewhat more
 * complicated.  The following things need to be taken care of.
 *
 *
 * \li Each object that has state that needs to be saved for restart
 *       must be derived from the Serializable class (which
 *       responds to the putToRestart() method).
 * \li Any object that needs to save its state to the restart file
 *       must be registered with the restart manager using the
 *       registerRestartItem() method.   NOTE THAT NO TWO RESTARTABLE
 *       OBJECTS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THE SAME NAME STRING IDENTIFIER.
 * \li The patchdata to be written to restart need to be specified
 *       using the VariableDatabase::setPatchdataForRestart() method.
 *       This is usually taken care of by the numerical algorithm object.
 *
 * When all these items are accounted for, writing to the restart file
 * is accomplished using a writeRestartFile() method.  There are
 * two writeRestartFile() methods available.  One takes only
 * a restart directory name as an argument whereas the other takes
 * both a restart directory name and a restore number for its arguments.
 * See comments for member functions for more details.
 *
 * @see Database
