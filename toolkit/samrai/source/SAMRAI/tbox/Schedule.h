/*!
 * @brief Class Schedule is used to construct and execute a set of
 * data communication transactions.  Each transaction represents some
 * data dependency and exchange between two processors, or locally
 * involving a single processor.
 *
 * Once a communication schedule is constructed, transactions are
 * provided to the schedule, using either the addTransaction() method
 * or the appendTransaction() method.  The schedule is then executed
 * forcing the communication, either interprocessor or local to occur.
 * The basic idea behind the schedule is that it enables the cost of
 * assembling communication dependencies and data transfers to be
 * amortized over many communication phases.
 *
 * Note that since the transactions are stored in lists, the "add" and
 * "append" mimick the semantics of the List class.  That is,
 * addTransaction() will put the transaction at the head of the list,
 * while appendTransaction() will put the transaction at the end of
 * the list.  This flexibility is provided for situations where the
 * order of transaction execution matters.  The transactions will be
 * executed in the order in which they appear in the list.

    * @brief Specify the message length (in bytes) used in the first
    * message when the receiving processor cannot determine the
    * message length.
    *
    * A receiving transaction cannot always determine the length of data
    * it is receiving.  In this case, first a message of length
    * first_message_length is sent.  The first message includes the full
    * length of the data that is being sent so the receiver can
    * determine if a second message, with the remainder of the data,
    * is needed.  If the length of the data being sent is less than
    * first_message_length, only a single message is sent.
    *
    * Setting a first_message_length too small creates the need for many
    * second messages.  Setting it to an excessive length wastes memory.
    *
    * This two message protocol was designed based on the observed
    * platform-dependent MPI implementation feature where a message of
    * a small length takes the same time as sending an empty message.
    * A protocol of sending the message length first and then a second
    * message with the data does not exploit this property.  The
    * message protocol SAMRAI uses of sending some small amount of
    * data with the first message does exploit this property and will
    * save the cost of always communicating two messages for small
    * messages.  Currently SAMRAI does not attempt to automatically
    * determine this message length however that may be added in
    * future versions.
    *
    * first_message_length defaults to 1000.
