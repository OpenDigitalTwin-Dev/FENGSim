/*!
 * @brief Class BoxOverlap is an abstract base class used to represent a region
 * where data will be communicated between two AMR patches.
 *
 * The exact form of the overlap will be determined by the subclass, which
 * will be implemented to handle a particular patch data class.  For example,
 * the rules for data intersection for face-centered data are different
 * from that for cell-centered data.
 *
 * The BoxOverlap class provides three functions.  First, it serves
 * as a base class that can answer the question whether an intersection
 * is empty, and is therefore useful for determining communication
 * dependencies.  Second, it holds information about any transformation (such
 * as a periodic shift) between a source and destination patch.  Third, it
 * is a storage location for the exact form of the intersection of the data
 * residing on two patches, which can be quite complicated (for example,
 * for face centered data).  To access the information about the intersection,
 * type-safe type casting should be used to access the subclass and its
 * member functions.
