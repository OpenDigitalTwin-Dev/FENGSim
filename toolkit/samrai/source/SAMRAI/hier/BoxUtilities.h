/**
 * Class BoxUtilities provides several utility routines for processing
 * boxes or collections of boxes.  Many of these operations require
 * information about the location of the input boxes within some region of
 * index space (domain) or are used to compute this sort of information.
 * Often these routines are used in load balancing and communication routines
 * to determine the relationship of a box or set of boxes to some domain
 * boundary, where the domain is specified by a list of box regions.
 *
 * The following provides an explanation some of the concepts
 * common to many of the functions in this class.
 *
 *     - \b cut point
 *
 *        A cut point for a coordinate direction is an integer that
 *        specifies the index value of the cell immediately to the
 *        right of the boundary along which a box will be cut.  For
 *        instance, if we have a cut point value of 12 in the y-coordinate
 *        direction for box [(0,0,0), (5,15,10)], then the box
 *        will be cut into [(0,0,0),(5,11,10)] and [(0,12,0),(5,15,10)].
 *        That is, the box has been cut along the boundary between
 *        the y = 11 and y = 12 cells.
 *
 *     - \b bad cut point
 *        If a box is cut at a "bad cut point", the resulting boxes
 *        will violate some of the box constraints. For example, a
 *        cut point that does not satify the cut factor restriction
 *        or violates the bad_interval constraint (see below)
 *        is a bad cut point.
 *
 *     - \b irregular boundary
 *        An irregular boundary results when the domain cannot be
 *        described by a single box and the domain is non-convex.
 *
 *
 * The following provides an explanation some of the arguments
 * common to many of the functions in this class.
 *
 *    - \b min_size
 *       min_size is a IntVector that specifies the minimum
 *       allowable box length in each direction.  For example, if
 *       min_size = (10,4,15), then the minimum box length in the
 *       x, y, and z directions are 10, 4, and 15 respectively.
 *
 *    - \b max_size
 *       max_size is a IntVector that specifies the maximum
 *       allowable box length in each direction.  For example, if
 *       max_size = (10,40,50), then the maximum box length in the
 *       x, y, and z directions are 10, 40, and 50 respectively.
 *
 *       It should be noted that the max_size constraint has lower
 *       priority than the other constraints.  In instances where
 *       all constraints cannot be simultaneously satisfied, the max_size
 *       constraint is sacrificed.
 *
 *    - \b cut_factor
 *       cut_factor is a IntVector that constrains the
 *       size of a box to be multiples of the components of the
 *       cut_factor.  For instance, if cut_factor = (2,4,5), then the
 *       x, y, and z directions of a 8 box that satisfies the cut_factor
 *       constraint would be multiples of 2, 4, and 5 respectively.
 *
 *       This constraint is usually enforced with the cut_factor equal
 *       to a multiple of the refinement ratio between levels to ensure
 *       that if the box is coarsened, the resulting box is aligned with
 *       the coarse grid (it is assumed that the boundary of the fine box
 *       is aligned with a coarse cell boundary).
 *
 *    - \b bad_interval
 *       bad_interval is a IntVector that limits the distance
 *       a box can be from the boundary of the box list domain so that
 *       the outer boundaries of the box and the box list domain which are
 *       perpendicular to the i-th direction are no closer than the i-th
 *       component of bad_interval.  Another way to think of this is that
 *       the boundary of the box list domain in the i-th direction is not
 *       allowed to lie strictly within the interior of the box after
 *       it has been grown in the i-th direction by the i-th component
 *       of bad_interval.  For example, if bad_interval = (2,3,4), then
 *       the x, y, and z boundaries of the box must be at least 2, 3, and
 *       4 cells away from the x, y, and z boundaries of the box list
 *       domain.
 *
 *       The bad_interval constraint is enforced to avoid the situation
 *       where the ghost region for a box resides partially inside and
 *       partially outside the box list domain which complicates ghost
 *       cell filling.  In addition, this constraint avoids complicated
 *       issues with respect to the numerical accuracy of the solution.
 *
 *       Typically, bad_interval is based on the maximum ghost cell
 *       width over all patch data objects and some coarsen ratio.
 *
 *
 * Note that all member functions of this class are static.  The main intent
 * of the class is to group the functions into one name space.  Thus, you
 * should never attempt to instantiate a class of type BoxUtilities;
 * simply call the functions as static functions; e.g.,
 * BoxUtilities::function(...).  These routines are placed here rather
 * than in the box, box list, box array classes to avoid circular dependencies
 * among these classes.
