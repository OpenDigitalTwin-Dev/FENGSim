/**
 * Class CoarsenOperator is an abstract base class for each
 * spatial coarsening operator used in the SAMRAI framework.  This class
 * defines the interface between numerical coarsening routines and the
 * rest of the framework.  Each concrete coarsening operator subclass
 * must provide four operations:
 *
 *
 *
 * - \b (1) {an implementation of the coarsening operation
 *            appropriate for its corresponding patch data type.}
 * - \b (2) {a function that determines whether or not the operator
 *             matches an arbitrary request for a coarsening operator.}
 * - \b (3) {a function that returns the stencil width of the operator
 *             (i.e., the number of ghost cells needed by the operator).}
 * - \b (4) {a function that returns an integer stating the priority of the
 *             operator with respect to other coarsening operators.}
 *
 *
 *
 * To add a new coarsening operator (either for a new patch data type
 * or for a new time coarsening routine on an existing type), define
 * the operator by inheriting from this abstract base class.  The operator
 * subclass must implement the coarsening operation in the coarsen()
 * function.  The stencil width and operator priority must be returned
 * from the getStencilWidth() and getOperatorPriority() functions,
 * respectively.  Then, the new operator must be added to the
 * operator list for the appropriate transfer geometry object using the
 * BaseGridGeometry::addCarsenOperator() function.
 *
 * Since spatial coarsening operators usually depend on patch data centering
 * and data type as well as the mesh coordinate system, they are defined
 * in the <EM>geometry</EM> package.
