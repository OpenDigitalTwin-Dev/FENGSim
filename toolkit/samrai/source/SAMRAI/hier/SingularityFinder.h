    * @brief Find the singularities based on the relationship between
    * face neighbors.
    *
    * The singularity information is computed based on the face_neighbors
    * input. In the nested map of maps face_neighbors, the key for the outer
    * map is a BoxId of a Box in the domain_boxes input (the reference Box).
    * For each reference Box,the inner map contains information about all its
    * face neighbors.
    *
    * Each face neighbor has a BoxId as its identifying key and
    * an integer to indicate which face of the reference Box the neighbor
    * touches. The formula for the integer identifier is:  For each normal
    * direction D = 0,...,NDIM-1, the lower face identifier is 2*D and the
    * upper face identifier is 2*D+1.
    *
    * The domain_boxes input is a representation of the physical domain that
    * must be set up such that all face neighbor relationships between
    * Boxes touch each other across the entirety of each Box face.
    *
    * @param[out] singularity_blocks Output for the computed singularities.
    *                                The outer set is the container of all
    *                                singularities, while each inner set
    *                                contains all of the BlockIds for the
    *                                blocks that touch one singularity.
    * @param[in] domain_boxes   Representation of the physical domain.
    * @param[in] grid_geometry  The grid geometry describing the multiblock
    *                           layout.
    * @param[in] face_neighbors Input information about face neighbor
    *                           relationships, described above.
