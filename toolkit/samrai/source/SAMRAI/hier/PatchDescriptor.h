/*!
 * @brief Class PatchDescriptor maintains a collection of patch data
 * factories and associated names that describes how patch data entries are
 * constructed on each patch in an AMR hierarchy.  The factory mechanism is
 * used to create new instances of concrete patch data objects without knowing
 * their actual types.  See the Design Patterns book by Gamma {\em et al.}
 * for more details about the Abstract Factory pattern.  Generally, a
 * PatchDescriptor object is intended to be shared among all patches (which are
 * distributed across processors) so that they store patch data objects in the
 * same way.
 *
 * Patch data factory objects (and associated names) are explicitly added to
 * the PatchDescriptor using the definePatchDataComponent() member function.
 * This function returns an integer index that can be used to identify the
 * corresponding patch data on a a patch.  Factories can be removed from the
 * PatchDescriptor using the removePatchDataComponent() member function, which
 * returns the integer index associated with the removed factory to a "free
 * list" so that it can be used again.  At any time, the valid range of indices
 * is >= 0 and < getMaxNumberRegisteredComponents().
 *
 * Note that the SAMRAIManager utility establishes a maximum number of patch
 * data object that may live on a Patch object which, for consistency, must be
 * the same as the number of patch data factories a PatchDescriptor will hold.
 * See the documentation of the SAMRAIManager utility for information about
 * changing this maximum value.
