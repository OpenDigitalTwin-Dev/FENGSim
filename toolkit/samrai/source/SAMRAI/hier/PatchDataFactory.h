/**
 * Class PatchDataFactory is an abstract base class used to allocate
 * new instances of patch data objects.  Recall that patch data objects (PDs)
 * are the data storage containers that exist within a patch.  PDs are
 * created using patch data factory (PDF) objects; this is an example of
 * the ``Abstract Factory'' method described in the Design Patterns book
 * by Gamma, et al.
 *
 * The separation of PDF from PD simplifies the creation of new concrete PD
 * classes since it separates the definition of the concrete class type from
 * the actual instantiation.  The actual concrete class associated with the
 * PDF is unknown to most of the framework; the PDF only defines enough
 * information to create the PD instance.  For example, to add a new type
 * of PD object MyPD (MyPatchData):
 * - Derive MyPDF from PDF and implement the abstract virtual
 *       function calls as appropriate for the concrete subclass;
 *       in particular, the allocate() function will return an instance
 *       of MyPD.
 * - Derive MyPD from PD and implement the abstract virtual
 *       function calls as appropriate for the concrete subclass.
 * - When defining the types of storage needed for a patch, add
 *       MyPDF to the patch descriptor list.
 * - Now whenever the PDF base class of MyPDF is asked to create
 *       a concrete class, it will create MyPD.
 * The creation of concrete PD objects is managed through the allocate()
 * interfaces in PDF.
 *
 * In addition to the generation of patch data, the patch data factory
 * also generates box geometry descriptions used to calculate the overlap
 * between two patch data objects.  The allocation of the box geometry
 * object is managed by the patch data factory instead of the patch data
 * object since patch data factories are guaranteed to exist on all of the
 * processors independent of the mapping of patches to processors.  Patch
 * data is guaranteed to exist only on those patches local to a processor.
