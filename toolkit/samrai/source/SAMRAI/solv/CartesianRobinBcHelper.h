 * @brief Helper utility for setting Robin boundary conditions.
 *
 * This class is intended as a helper for performing the tedious
 * task of setting boundary values for scalar quantities for the
 * general case of boundary conditions known as the Robin boundary
 * condition.
 *
 * It uses the Robin boundary condition coefficients specified
 * by a RobinBcCoefStrategy object to determine the boundary
 * value to set.  The exact value set depends on the allignment of
 * the data and is derived from various discrete approximations
 * of the Robin formula.  This class currently supports cell-centered
 * alignment and will support node-centered alignment in the future.
 *
 * See RobinBcCoefStrategy for the description of the Robin
 * boundary condition.
 *
 * This class inherits and implements virtual functions from
 * xfer::RefinePatchStrategy so it may be used to help create
 * communication schedules if desired.

    * @name Functions to set boundary condition values

   /*!
    * @brief Set the physical boundary condition by setting the
    * value of the first ghost cells.
    *
    * This function has an interface similar to the virtual function
    * xfer::RefinePatchStrategy::setPhysicalBoundaryConditions(),
    * and it may be used to help implement that function,
    * but it does not serve the same purpose.  The primary
    * differences are:
    * -# It specializes to cell-centered variables.
    * -# Only one ghost cell width is filled.  Setting a Robin
    *    boundary condition for cell-centered quantities requires
    *    only one ghost cell to be set.
    *    (More ghost cells can be filled by continuing the linear
    *    distribution of data beyond the first cell, but that is
    *    not implemented at this time.)
    * -# User must specify the index of the data whose ghost
    *    cells need to be filled.  This index is used to determine
    *    the variable for which to set the boundary coefficients
    *    and to get the data to be set.
    *
    * This function calls RobinBcStrategy::setBcCoefs() to
    * get the coefficients, then it sets the values in the first
    * ghost cell on the boundary.
    *
    * To determine the value for the ghost cell,
    * a @em linear approximation in the direction normal to the
    * boundary is assumed.  We write the following discrete
    * approximations:
    * @f[ u_b = \frac{ u_i + u_o }{2} @f]
    * @f[ [u_n]_b = \frac{ u_o - u_i }{h} @f]
    * where the subscript b stands for the the boundary,
    * i stands for the first cell inside the boundary and
    * o stands for the first cell outside the boundary
    * and h is the grid spacing normal to the boundary.
    * Applying this to the Robin formula gives
    * @f[ u_o = \frac{ h\gamma + u_i( \beta - \frac{h}{2} \alpha ) }
    * { \beta + \frac{h}{2} \alpha } @f] or equivalently
    * @f[ u_o = \frac{ hg + u_i (1-a(1+\frac{h}{2})) }{ 1-a(1-\frac{h}{2}) } @f]
    *
    * After setting the edge (face in 3D) boundary conditions,
    * linear approximations are used to set the boundary conditions
    * of higher boundary types (nodes in 2D, edges and nodes in 3D).
    *
    * In some cases, the calling function wants to set the
    * boundary condition homogeneously, with g=0.
    * This is useful in problems where the the solution of the
    * homogeneous problem is required in solving the inhomogeneous
    * problem.  This function respects such requests specified
    * through the argument @c homogeneous_bc.
    *
    * @internal To be more general to other data types,
    * there could be versions for other data types also,
    * such as ...InNodes, ...InFaces, etc.  However, I'm not
    * sure exactly how to implement the Robin boundary condition
    * on the faces and nodes when m != 1.  Should the boundary
    * value be set or should the first ghost value be set?
    *
    * @internal I have not addressed possibility of differences
    * in chosing the discrete formulation with which to compute
    * the boundary value.  The above formulation is obviously
    * one specific approximation, but there could be others.
    * If anoter approximation is required, there should be
    * another class like this or this class can offer a choice
    * to be set by the user.  I favor another class.
    *
    * @internal Since the data alignment can be found through
    * the target_data_id, these types of functions may be changed
    * to just plain setBoundaryValues or setBoundaryValuesInBoundaryBoxes
    * since it does assume boundary boxes.  This may have to be
    * expanded to later include coarse-fine boundary boxes
    * for more generality.
    *

    * @param target_data_id hier::Patch data index of data to be set.
