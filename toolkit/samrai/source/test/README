#########################################################################

The SAMRAI/source/test directory contains test codes that
verify correctness of various components in the library.  
All tests included here are run through our autotest suite
to assure accurate results.

The following summarizes the tests carried out in the 
different sub-directories:

applications:   
   Compile cases in the /source/applications directory
   with the local "AutoTester" class included.  The AutoTester
   class checks the state of various objects used in the 
   application at the end of the run and compares them to 
   the expected "correct" result entered in the input file.

   The Euler case carries out one additional test on the
   correctness of the Riemann problem.  Data files specify 
   the correct fluxes after a certain number of steps (to
   10 digits accuracy).  The solution can be verified by
   doing a "diff" on the output data file with these
   correct result files.

   Requires the testlib be built.

async_comm:
   Unit test of asynchronous communication.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/async_comm
   directory.

boundary:
   A set of tests to check the correctness of the routines to set various 
   physical boundary conditions supplied by the CartesianBoundaryUtilities
   classes in the Application Utilities package.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/boundary
   directory.

clustering:
   Unit test of Berger Rigoutsos algorithm.

   Requires the testlib be built.

communication:
   Performs a set of tests that invoke data transfer operations
   between patches using cell, face, node, and side datatypes.
   In addition to communication, this test verifies the accuracy
   of the interpolation (i.e. coarsen and refine) operations 
   carried out on these various datatypes.  The grid hierarchy 
   configuration and number of processors may be set through the 
   input file.  

   Requires the testlib be built.

dataaccess:
   Unit test of SAMRAI PatchData access via PatchData iterators and Indexes.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/dataaccess
   directory.

dataops:
   Tests various data operations with cell, face, node, side, and edge
   centerings across the hierarchy and for a variety of underlying datatypes.
   The operations set data on patches and test operations like linear_sum(),
   dot_product(), axmy(), etc. on the hierarchy.  The grid hierarchy is fixed.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/dataops
   directory.

dimension:
   Unit test of SAMRAI Dimension class.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/dimension
   directory.

dlbg:
   Test of the BergerRigoutsos algorithm and the Connectors generated by it.

   Requires the testlib be built.

FAC_adaptive:
   Test of FAC solver which uses true mesh adaptivity based on the evolution of
   the solution.  A variety of functionally defined boundary conditions are
   applied depending on which test is run.

   Requires the testlib be built.

FAC_nonadaptive:
   Unit test of FAC solver which uses pre-set user defined refined boxes.  The
   mesh is adaptive but not in a "real" sense.  Simple constant boundary
   conditions are used.

   All test source code is contained in the SAMRAI/source/test/FAC_nonadaptive
