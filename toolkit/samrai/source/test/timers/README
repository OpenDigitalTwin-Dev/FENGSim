This test case tests the functionality of the timer and statistician
classes in SAMRAI.

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make checkcompile

   Execution:
      serial:
         ./statstest
         ./timertest test_inputs/test.input
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  These examples demonstrate
         execution via mpirun.
            mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./statstest
            mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./timertest test_inputs/test.input

      Restarted Run:

         same format as regular run but add <restart dir> <restore num>
         to end of command.
            <restart dir> is directory where restart files are stored
                          (set in input file).
            <restore num> is the identifier of which restart file to use
                          (generally the timestep).

         example:  (to start from timestep #0)

           ./timertest test_inputs/test.input restart 0
           mpirun -np <nprocs> ./timertest [mpirun options] test_inputs/test.input restart 0

         NOTE:  The ordinary use of our restart functionality requires that
                a problem can only be restarted on on the same number of
                processors on which the problem was originally run.  To restart
                on a different number of processors, use the
                restart-redistribute tool in SAMRAI/tools/restart.

timertest (What it does)
------------------------
   This test will measure the time per call to invoke timers in your code.
   To run, set the following two variables in the input file:
      ntimes - number of times timer is called
      exclusive_tree_depth - depth of exclusive timers

   Run #1:                           Run #2:
      print_exclusive  = FALSE           = TRUE
      print_concurrent = FALSE           = TRUE
   Output to log file will show wallclock time for the calls.  Time per call
   is computed as follows:

   unregistered timer = wall time for apps::main::timer_off/ntimes
   registered timer =  Run #1: wall time for apps:main:timer_on/ntimes
   exclusive timer =   Run #2: wall time for apps::main:exclusive_timer/
                                    (ntimes*exclusive_tree_depth)

   The following are results measured on some systems we support,
   with ntimes = 1000, exclusive_timer_depth = 5.

      exclusive timer       4.00e-5 sec/call         4.02e-5 sec/call

statstest (What it does)
------------------------
   Mimics an actual time dependent integration loop by building a  
   statistician object that records current simulation time and some
   dummy integer value (e.g. could be gridpoints).  Outputs this to
   log file at the end.                        
 

INPUTS:
