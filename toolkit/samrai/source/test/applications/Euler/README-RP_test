The RP_test input files implement three different problems:

1.  testX-1-2d - Sod shock tube
       Tests Sod shock tube problem in the X direction in 2D.
       (coupled RP-testX-2d.input with RP-test1.data in the RP_input
       directory in the applications directory).  50 timesteps  

2.  testY-3-3d - left side, Woodward Colella blast wave
       Tests Woodward-Colella problem in the Y direction in 3D.
       (coupled RP-testY-3d.input with RP-test3.data in the RP_input
       directory in the applications directory).  75 timesteps.

3.  testZ-6-3d - slow moving contact discontinuity 
       Tests contact discontinuity problem in Z direction in 3D.
       (coupled RP-testZ-3d.input with RP-test6Z.data in the RP_input
       directory in the applications directory).  60 timesteps.

An input file, a "correct" solution file, and a plot of the solution
are included for each of these tests:

    <test name>.input - input file for the test
    <test name>_<timestep>.correct - data file with the "correct" 
                        solution at the specified timestep.
    <test name>_<timestep>.jpg - JPEG image file showing plots of the
                        solution at the specified step.

To run a test and compare with the correct solution, do the following:

1.  Run the test case with the appropriate input file:
       ./main RP_test/testY-3-3d.input

2.  Compare the *.dat file (written to the RP_test directory) to the
    correct solution:
       diff testY-3-3d_0060.dat testY-3-3d_0060.correct
