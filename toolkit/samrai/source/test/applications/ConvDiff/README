This README explains how to compile and run the Convection Diffusion example
which uses an adaptive Runge-Kutta time integration. The files included in
this directory are as follows:

          main.cpp                 -  application driver program
          MainRestartData.[C,h]  -  just a holder for general run control
                                    parameters such as start and end time and
                                    number of time steps
          ConvDiff.[C,h]         -  C++ class containing routines specific to
                                    the ConvDiff example and which are called
                                    from SAMRAI AMR library routines
          ConvDiffFort.h         -  header file defining external fortran
                                    routines
          fortran/2d,3d          -  Fortran numerical routines for 2d,3d
                                    problems.

To understand the construction of this application code from pieces
specific to the ConvDiff model and more generic pieces in the SAMRAI
library consider the object construction pattern in the main.cpp file.
For more details on library classes and the ConvDiff class consult
the comments in the header files for the library classes and the
ConvDiff.h class header file.


COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Run:
      serial:
         ./main test_inputs/test.[2,3]d.input
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] main test_inputs/test.[2,3]d.input

   There are also example input files in the subdirectory example_inputs.
      sphere.2d.input - advecting sphere in a box with fixed boundaries
      sphere.3d.input - advecting sphere in a cube with fixed boundaries
      heated_floor.2d.input  - mimics a heated floor, demonstrating diffusion.

   The test and example input files contain comments describing the input
   parameters specific to this problem.  Descriptions of input parameters for
   library classes will be found in the documentation of those classes as well
   their header files.


INPUT PARAMETER
---------------
Refer to test_inputs/test2d.input for full description of all input parameters
specific to this problem.


RESETTING BASELINES
-------------------
The tests that are run from this directory include comparisons of the results
to baseline data that represent expected results.  The tests compare the
box configuration of the hierarchy, and certain timestep floating point values,
as specified in the AutoTester input described above.  The baseline boxes
are stored in HDF data files, and the expected timestep values are listed
in the AutoTester input.

If a SAMRAI developer makes changes to the library that can legitimately change
the box configuration of a hierarchy, then the baselines here need to be reset,
according to the following steps

1. Change the AutoTester input block in each input file to include these
   two entries:

     write_patch_boxes = TRUE
     read_patch_boxes = FALSE

2. Comment out all of the lines that read restart files in the
   Makefile's check2d and check3d rules.

3. make check.  The baseline HDF files will be regenerated here.

4. If you get floating-point-difference errors when the "correct_result"
   values are compared, do the following

   a. set output_correct = TRUE in the AutoTester input

   b. make check

   c. Find the new values of the three floating-point outputs in the log
      file, and put them on the line "correct_result = ..."
      (make sure they don't differ too much).

5. Undo all makefile and input file changes (except for changes to
   correct_results).

6. make checktest (there should be no more errors).
