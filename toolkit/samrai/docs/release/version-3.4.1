                Significant bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Random operations in the math component passed the improper reduction
    to Allreduce (e.g. MPI_MAX instead of MPI_SUM).  In addition there were
    a couple of operations which took the max of a min rather than the max of
    a max.  All of the operations in this component have been carefully
    examined and all errors of this type have been fixed.

(2) Bugs that were causing incorrect Connectors and fill patterns to be used
    for filling ghost data at multiblock enhanced connectivity coarse-fine
    boundaries have been fixed.

(3) GriddingAlgorithm forces patches on new levels that lie very near to a
    physical or block boundary to be extended to touch that boundary.  In
    multiblock configurations, this requirement was not being enforced
    correctly on blocks other than block 0.  This has now been fixed.

                Summary of what's new

    for effiencent search operations.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) SAMRAI's Pointer class has been replaced by the boost shared_ptr.
    SAMRAI's ConstPointer has also been eliminated.

    THIS NOW MAKES BOOST HEADERS REQUIRED.

(2) Starting/stopping a Timer that is already started/stopped is an
    error in both optimize and debug modes.

(3) BlockId is now part of Box's state rather than part of BoxId.

(4) SAMRAI's iterator classes have been modified to use a consistent syntax
    which matches the accepted conventions of the STL.

(5) SAMRAI's tbox containers which effectively replicated equivalent STL
    containers have been removed.

(6) The GridGeometry class hierarchy has been changed.

                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BoxContainer can create and hold its own internal tree representation
    for effiencent search operations.

    The method makeTree() can be used to create an internal spatially-based
    tree representation of the BoxContainer, which can increase efficiency
    when the container is used as a constant argument to search-based
    methods such as intersectBoxes() or findOverlapBoxes().  The cost of
    building a tree is O(N log(N)), while it reduces the cost of the search
    methods from O(N) to O(log(N)), so users should only use the tree
    representation when it is expected that the same BoxContainer will be
    used repeatedly as an argument to search operations, such that the
    gain in efficiency outweighs the cost of building the tree.

    With this functionality added to BoxContainer, most of the public
    interfaces of the BoxTree and MultiblockBoxTree classes have been
    removed, as theses classes are intended to only be used internally by
    BoxContainer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) SAMRAI's Pointer class was written long before standard smart or reference
    counted pointer classes were available.  It's implementation relied heavily
    on dynamic_casts and as such there was unncecssary overhead associated with
    its use.  We have removed Pointer from the library and replaced its usage
    with boost's shared_ptr.  This class provides a more efficient
    implementation and an API which uses common idioms.  We have also removed
    ConstPointer which was redundant as ConstPointer<X> was equivalent to
    Pointer<const X>.

(2) Starting/stopping a Timer that is already started/stopped is an
    error in both optimize and debug modes.

    Previous behavior: This caused a failed assert in debug mode but not
    in optimized mode.

(3) BlockId is now part of Box's state rather than part of BoxId.  This means
    that every Box should have a valid BlockId that identifies which block it
    lies on within a multiblock mesh configuration.  For single-block
    configurations, the value of every Box's BlockId is zero.

    Transformations of a Box from the coordinate system of one block to,
    another, using methods in the Transformation or grid geometry classes,
    will automatically change the BlockId as appropriate.

    There is now no BlockId held inside BoxId, and thus BoxId's ordering,
    scheme, which is used in some containers such as BoxContainer, no longer
    takes into account BlockId.

(4) The syntax of SAMRAI's iterator classes have, for some time, not been self
    consistent.  In addition they have not been particularly consistent with
    accepted iterator syntax found in the STL.  We have modified all of the
    libraries iterator so that they have the following methods/operators:
    a)  Both pre and post increment operators.  The pre-increment operator
        returns a reference to the incremented iterator.  The post-increment
        operator returns the iterator as it existed prior to being incremented.
    b)  Both == and != operators.
    c)  The conventional dereference operator, *.
    d)  The conventional member access operator, ->, which is equivalent to
        (*itr)..
    e)  An assignment operator.
    f)  For bidirectional iterator, both pre and post decrement operators.

    In addition, there are now the usual iterator/const_iterator typedefs for
    the iterators defined in the classes on which the iterators operate.  An
    example is BoxContainer::iterator.

    Since the iterators now have syntax consistent with the STL it is possible
    to use ths STL's algorithms with SAMRAI's iterators.

    Modifications to client code will be necessary but we believe that the
    future ease of use resulting from a consistent API along with the potential
    for use of STL algorithms makes this an acceptable cost.

(5) When SAMRAI was first developed, the STL was not a widely used and accepted
    library.  As a result the SAMRAI library included its own container classes
    which were effectively identical to those in the STL.  We have removed them
    from the library as of 3.4.  These classes are vector and List.
    Applications should now use vector and list from the STL.

(6) hier::GridGeometry has been renamed hier::BaseGridGeometry and is now an
    abstract class.  A new class, geom::GridGeometry, provides the concrete
    equivalent of hier::GridGeometry.  The class, geom::CartesianGridGeometry
    is derived from geom::GridGeometry.  The class, geom::SkeletonGridGeometry
    has been removed as it is essentially equivalent to geom::GridGeometry.

    If your application uses hier::GridGeometry you should just need to change
    "hier" to "geom".

    These changes were necessary because knowledge of how refine, coarsen, and
    time interpolations operators are bound to different variables must be
    bound to the GridGeometry.  Only a specific, concrete GridGeometry can
    know which, if any, operator is valid for a given variable.  Thus, a pure
    virtual method, buildOperators() has been introduced to
    hier::BaseGridGeometry.  It is defined by geom::GridGeometry to build the
    proper operators for that grid geometry context.  Class
    geom::CartesianGridGeometry overrides the method to add the Cartesian
    operators.
