Where to report Bugs
--------------------

If a bug is found in the SAMRAI library, we ask that you kindly report
it to us so that we may fix it.

Please send email to samrai-bugs@llnl.gov.

*****************************************************************************

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Significant bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) A major bug that was incorrectly setting up the transactions for time
interpolation during runs with TimeRefinementIntegrator using refined
timestepping has been fixed.  Codes that use refined timestepping may see
changes in results due to more accurate time-interpolated values used to fill
ghost data.

2) An integer overrun that was seen in runs using a high number of levels
(16 or more) has been eliminated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) (v. 3.10.0) Non-uniform load balancing capabilities have been added to
CascadePartitioner.

2) CompositeBoundaryAlgorithm and CompositeBoundarySchedule provide new
functionality for representations of PatchData at boundaries between coarse
and fine levels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The maximum number of patch data items that managesd by SAMRAIManager
is no longer a hard limit.

                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) (v. 3.11.0) Non-uniform load balancing capabilities have been added to
CascadePartitioner.

The CascadePartitioner now has the ability to balance based on user-provided
workload values for each cell instead of balancing based on a simple cell
count.  The non-uniform capability is enabled by passing in a patch data id
to the method setWorkloadPatchDataIndex.  The patch data id should identify
cell-centered data that has already been set on the hierarchy prior to invoking
the CascadePartitioner.

CascadePartitioner continues to work as a uniform load balancer by default.

2) CompositeBoundaryAlgorithm and CompositeBoundarySchedule provide new
functionality for representations of PatchData at boundaries between coarse
and fine levels.

These classes are intended to support applications that may need to operate on
data on both sides of a coarse-fine boundary, treating them as an irregular
stencil that incorporates different mesh resolutions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The maximum number of patch data items that managesd by SAMRAIManager
is no longer a hard limit.

Previously if an application tried to create more patch data items than the
limit held by SAMRAIManager (default value of 256, or can be set using
SAMRAIManager::setMaxNumberPatchDataEntries()), it would cause a fatal error.
Now SAMRAIManager will adjust the maximum value on the fly and the application
will need not do anything to adjust.

It still is recommended that application codes set a value at the beginning of
the run that is higher than they expect to ever reach, as the adjustment of the
maximum value has some overhead, but for some applications it is unpredictable
how many patch data items will be created, and this change allows them to
run without worry of a hard limit causing an error.
