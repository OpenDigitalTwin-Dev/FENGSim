Where to report Bugs
--------------------

If a bug is found in the SAMRAI library, we ask that you kindly report it
to us so that we may fix it.  We will make every effort to fix bugs
in a timely manner.  Depending on the severity or the complexity of the
bug, we will either fix the bug for a subsequent library release or send
a code fix to users so that their work is minimally interrupted.

LLNL users should report bugs using the CASC bug tracking web pages:

        http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs/

Enter the bug into the appropriate area of the SAMRAI project section.

Bugs found by other users should send email to samrai-bugs@llnl.gov.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed 
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed 
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) BasePatchHierarchy and BasePatchLevel abstract base classes added
to be parent classes for original PatchHierarchy and PatchLevel as well
as multiblock hierarchy and level classes.  Similar BaseGriddingAlgorithm
class also added

(2) Methods added to create a refined or coarsened version of an existing 
patch hierarchy.

(3) The construction of BoundaryBox now uses a singleton class called
BoundaryLookupTable which was necessary to make SAMRAI capable of handling
spatial dimensions greater than 3.  This caused a change to the ordering
of the location indices for 3D BoundaryBox objects of codimension 2.  Users
are now given the option of using the old ordering for backward compatibility
or using the new ordering.

(4) STL classes are now used by the SAMRAI library.  We take explicit
steps to instantiate them because SAMRAI compiles without implicit
template instantation.

(5) Functions added to the SAMRAIManager utility class to allow the number of
patch data components supported by the component selector bit vectors and patch
descriptor to be increased/decreased as needed.  The new functions are:
tbox::SAMRAIManager::setMaxNumberPatchDataEntries() and
tbox::SAMRAIManager::getMaxNumberPatchDataEntries().  See the SAMRAIManager 
class documentation for details.

(6) Several new classes have been added to support individual patch data 
components to be defined on subsets of patches in an AMR patch hierarchy,
so called "locally-active" patch data.  In the hierarchy package, the new 
classes are: LocallyActiveVariableDatabase and LocallyActiveDataPatchLevelManager.
The LocallyActiveVariableDatabase is a Singleton class derived from the VariableDatabase
Singleton class.  This class operates similarly to the standard variable database, but 
provides a reduced set of variable registration and variable-patch data index mapping
functionality.  The LocallyActiveVariableDatabase provides access to locally-active
patch level manager objects which allow one to define on which patches on a level that
individual patch data components are active.  The manager class provides patch level
iterators that iterate over patches on which individual patch data components are active.
The manager class can also be used independently of the locally-active variable database.
Coarsen/Refine communication algorithm and schedule classes have been added to the transfer
package to support communication operations for locally-active patch data.  Their usage
and functionality are similar to the standard SAMRAI communication algorithm and schedule
classes.

*****************************************************************************
	           Converting from SAMRAI 1.x to 2.0
*****************************************************************************

*****************************************************************************
	           Introduction to the 2.0 API changes.
*****************************************************************************

The SAMRAI API has changed dramatically in the 2.0 release.  This will
require you to make a large number of changes to your code, but the
changes are fairly trivial in nature so the process is relatively easy
but time consuming.  We have provided automated scripts to ease the
conversion process.  The script will not make all required changes,
but should significantly reduce the time to convert codes.

The change should not introduce hidden errors, since it involves class
name changes.  If something is not correct it will not compile so any
errors should be reasonably transparent.

We made every effort to figure out a way to provide backward
compatibility header files; however, we could not find a method to do
this.

The first significant change involves how we partition the class
names.  In the 1.x release API we used a name prefix on the class
names (e.g. tbox_Array) to avoid name conflicts.  The 2.0 version uses
the C++ standardized namespace technology to partition the packages
(e.g. SAMRAI::tbox::Array). If you are not familiar with namespaces
you may want to look at your favorite C++ book.

The second major change involves the way we handle dimensioned
classes.  In previous releases of SAMRAI there was a different class
for each dimension (e.g. hier_Box1, hier_Box2, and hier_Box3).  Due to
user requests for higher dimensions we now template on the dimension
(e.g. SAMRAI::hier::Box<int DIM>). [NOTE: Not all of SAMRAI is
currently working for DIM>3, if you try to use a class we have not
converted you should receive a compiler or runtime error]

The third major change from the 1.x API is a reduction in the
number of "styles" of headers included in SAMRAI.  We had three
distinct ways of accessing the classes in SAMRAI.  These have been
reduced to a single include method.


*****************************************************************************
	           What does the new API look like?
*****************************************************************************

Here are examples of the three "styles" of headers the 1.x API
supported and how the new 2.0 code looks:


Style 1) Dimensioned classes with package names.

----------------------------------------------------------
#include "hier_IntVector1.h"
#include "hier_IntVector2.h"
#include "pdat_CellData2.h"

int main()
{
    hier_IntVector1                 vector_a;
    hier_IntVector2                 vector_b;
    pdat_CellData2<double>          data;
}
---------------------------------------------------------- 

Style 2) Dimensioned classes without package names.

----------------------------------------------------------
#include "IntVector1.h"
#include "IntVector2.h"
#include "CellData2.h"

int main()
{
    IntVector1                vector_a;
    IntVector2                vector_b
    CellData2<double>         data;
}
----------------------------------------------------------

Styles (1) and (2) can be written using qualified names:

----------------------------------------------------------
#include "IntVector.h"
#include "CellData.h"


int main()
{
    // Class names no longer contain the dimension, classes
    // are templated on the dimension.
    SAMRAI::hier::IntVector<1>              vector_a;
    SAMRAI::hier::IntVector<2>              vector_b
    SAMARAI::pdat::CellData<2,double>       data;
}
---------------------------------------------------------- 

You can use the C++ "using namespace" to avoid 
qualifying the names.

----------------------------------------------------------
#include "IntVector.h"
#include "CellData.h"

using namespace SAMRAI;
using namespace hier;
using namespace pdat;

int main()
{
    // Class names no longer contain the dimension, classes
    // are templated on the dimension.
    IntVector<1>              vector_a;
    IntVector<2>              vector_b
    CellData<2,double>        data;
}
---------------------------------------------------------- 


Style 3) Non-dimensioned classes without package names.

Note the dimension comes from the compile time definition of NDIM in
both cases.  To get a 2D version of the code you used -DNDIM=2 on
the compile line.

----------------------------------------------------------
#include "IntVector.h"
#include "CellData.h"

int main()
{
    IntVector                vector;
    CellData<double> data;
}
----------------------------------------------------------

The new method is similar, but you will see the "NDIM" symbol in your
code instead hiding it in the header files.

----------------------------------------------------------
#include "IntVector.h"
#include "CellData.h"
using namespace SAMRAI;

int main()
{
    hier::IntVector<NDIM>             vector;
    pdat::CellData<NDIM, double>      data;
}
----------------------------------------------------------

Note here we only use a "using namespace" to bring in the SAMRAI
namespace and retain the namespace qualifiers for each of the package
names.

*****************************************************************************
	How do I convert my code?
*****************************************************************************

You can make the code changes manually.  This requires changing:

a) Remove package prefixes (if needed) from included headers.
   Toolbox headers are located in a subdirectory of include to 
   help avoid name collisions (e.g. #include "tbox/Utility.h").

b) Add package namespace qualifiers or "using namespace" statements 
   to class names.

c) Add templating to classes that currently end in a dimension.


We have provided a set of scripts to help automate the conversion
process.  The scripts are not perfect and some editing is usually
required but they help with the drudgery.  

Make sure you have a backup of your code in case the conversion
process fails.

Run the SAMRAI/tools/scripts/conversion2.0/convert2.0 at the root of
your source directory.  This should convert #include statements and
rename classes that are templated.

If you use the non-prefix header files (and thus non-prefix class
names) you have three options.

First, you can run the "packagePrefixPrepend" script to insert the
package namespace into each class use.  For example IntVector would be
replace with hier::IntVector.

The second option is for you to manually add "using namespace"
statements to your code.  You can do this by determining which
packages you use and adding a "using namespace PACKAGE" for each one.

The last alternative is a variation of the second, put a using
namespace for all packages in your code and then remove the ones that
cause an error during compilation (you can't have a "using namespace"
for a package you don't actually use).  This is a little crude but
depending on how familiar you are with the packages this might be
easier than the second option.  Here is a complete list of all
packages in SAMRAI:

using namespace SAMRAI;
using namespace tbox;
using namespace hier;
using namespace xfer;
using namespace pdat;
using namespace math;
using namespace mesh;
using namespace mblk;
using namespace geom;
using namespace solv;
using namespace algs;
using namespace appu;

Issues using the scripts:

(a) Please backup your files!

We have run the scripts on several codes without harm but you don't
want to be the person to find a serious bug in the scripts without
having a backup.

(b) Input file naming changes.

Some input parameters use class names in them, the scripts do not make
changes in input files.  You will need to change the input files that
have references to packages.  E.G.

algs_GriddingAlgorithm becomes algs::GriddingAlgorithm
algs_HyperbolicLevelIntegrator becomes algs::HyperbolicLevelIntegrator

are the most common changes needed.

*****************************************************************************
                 End Converting from SAMRAI 1.x to 2.0
*****************************************************************************

(1) Change in link symbols LIBSAMRAI and LIBSAMRAIXD in the
makefile Makefile.config and addition of LIBSAMRAIDEPEND.

If you are linking with SAMRAI using the provided Makefile.config 
macros you will need to change the symbol used for the dependency target 
for SAMRAI.

If you are doing something similar to:

main2d:	$(CXX_OBJS) $(F2D_OBJS) $(LIBSAMRAI)
		$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(CXX_OBJS) $(F2D_OBJS)	\
		$(LIBSAMRAI2D) $(LIBSAMRAI) $(LDLIBS) -o main2d

you will need change the $(LIBSSAMRAI) macro to $(LIBSAMRAIDEPEND) in
the dependency list:

main2d:	$(CXX_OBJS) $(F2D_OBJS) $(LIBSAMRAIDEPEND)
		$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(CXX_OBJS) $(F2D_OBJS)	\
		$(LIBSAMRAI2D) $(LIBSAMRAI) $(LDLIBS) -o main2d

Internally the library symbols for SAMRAI are now defined as -lSAMRAI and 
-L is used to set the path to the library directory.

This change was needed to improve the ability to build SAMRAI as a set 
of shared libraries.

(2) As stated in the RELEASE file of versions 1.4 and 1.5, the obsolete
FAC Poisson solver in SAMRAI/source/solvers/OLD.FAC is now removed.
This version tightly coupled the FAC cycling code with the
Poisson-specific code.  The FAC code has been abstracted out, placed
in SAMRAI/source/solvers/FAC and made more general.  Poisson-specific
code and cell-centered Poisson solvers using HYPRE and FAC now exists
in SAMRAI/source/solvers/poisson.

(3) ShutdownRegistry API changed to include a priority.

The registerShutdownRoutine now takes a priority to enable some control
over the order of shutdowns.  Some services have dependencies between 
them and shutting down services in an arbitrary ordering is not
advisable.  The priority is between 0 and 254 with higher numbers
being shutdown first.  Users are reserved priorities 254 to 127; all
SAMRAI services will use 126-0.

The old method was:

   static void registerShutdownRoutine(void (*callback)());

The new method is:

   static void registerShutdownRoutine(void (*callback)(),
                                       unsigned char priority);

Bugzilla # 596.

(4) Memory leak fixes.

SAMRAI was leaking a small amount of memory (~200KB in the LinAdv example 
problem) due to some incorrect shutdown of services.  This was a constant 
sized leak (did not grow with problem size or length of run).

Bugzilla # 598

(5)

(6) For clarity and to support new functionality, the pure virtual
methods in the GridGeometry base class have changed.  The various
versions of the previous pure virtual method setPatchGeometry() have
been removed and their functionality has been moved from concrete grid
geometry classes to the GridGeometry base class.  The new pure virtual
methods in Grid Geometry are makeRefinedGridGeometry(),
makeCoarsenedGridGeometry(), and setGeometryDataOnPatch().  The first
two methods are required to create refined/coarsened versions of a
concrete Grid Geometry object to support the nwe functionality to
create refined and coarsened versions of an existing patch hierarchy
(item (2) in "what's new").  The third method computes grid data
specific to a coordinate system for a patch and assigns a new concrete
patch geometry object to a patch upon creation.

(7) The file String.h removed. Users should use the standard string
header file.

(8) Visit data writer failure to properly close HDF files fixed.

The Visit writer was not correctly closing the HDF files.  If a SAMRAI
application stopped prematurely (e.g. core dump), the HDF files may
not have been written correctly to disk.

(9) Sun IEEE floating point changes.

A user supplied patch was applied for the IEEE floating point handling
routines.

(10) Make install destination directory changed.

Previous verions of SAMRAI created intermediate directories when doing
a "make install".  This feature was removed. For example when doing a
configure with a prefix option "--prefix=/usr/local/SAMRAI", the
actual install directory would be something like
"/usr/local/SAMRAI/Linux-gcc-opt".  The new "make install" does not
append the "Linux-gcc-opt" subdirectory.  This is more consitent with
other packages.

(11) Heterogeneous computer cluster support is disabled by default.

By heterogeneous clusters we mean running SAMRAI in parallel across
machines of different IEEE floating point representations (like big
ended and little ended storage).  Since we not not aware of any SAMRAI
user doing this we have made this support an optional configure flag.
If you are using a heterogeneous cluster you need to add the
"--enable-xdr" flag on your configure line.

As a reminder, you also need to set 

tbox_MessageStream::useXDR(true);

in your application code (this change was introduced in release 1.5.0 see
the release notes in docs/release/version-1.5.0)

(12) Setting obscure SAMRAI internal options via input values using
the "GlobalInputs" input database has been disabled.

SAMRAI internal options can still be set by a user by calling an
appropriate static class member function.  A user wishing to control
an option via input must manage this on his/her own since the
GlobalInputs input database has been removed.  SAMRAI internal options
that may be set using the following static member function calls.
Information about valid options and what each option does may be found
in the appropriate class header file.

o Set whether exit or abort is called when running a single processor job:

tbox::SAMRAI_MPI::setCallAbortInSerialInsteadOfExit(bool);

o Setting algorithm for box intersection operations in communication schedules:

xfer::RefineSchedule<NDIM>::setScheduleGenerationMethod(const string& method);
xfer::CoarsenSchedule<NDIM>::setScheduleGenerationMethod(const string& method);

o Setting algorithm for reducing tags in clustering process:

mesh::BergerRigoutsos<NDIM>::setClusteringOption(const string& method);

(13) Residual norm in CellPoissonHypreSolver has been changed to
relative residual norm for clarity.  You should change input parameters
from "residual_tol" to "relative_residual_tol".  The accessor method
getResidualNorm should be replaced with getRelativeResidualNorm.

(14) All input parameters for FAC solvers' coarse level solver now start
with 'coarse_solver...', whereas there was previously no consistency between
the various classes that implement the FAC solver.  You may have to check
your input files.  Change all parameters starting with "coarsest_..."
or "coarse_level...", etc. to "coarse_solver...".

(15) GNUMake required for build

Standard make is no longer supported by the SAMRAI build system, GNUMake is 
required.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BasePatchHierarchy and BasePatchLevel abstract base classes added
to be parent classes for original PatchHierarchy and PatchLevel as well
as multiblock hierarchy and level classes.  Similar BaseGriddingAlgorithm
class also added.

The functionalities of PatchHierarchy, PatchLevel, and GriddingAlgorithm are
not changed, but the usage of these classes is changed in some circumstances.
Notably, the interface for PatchHierarchy::getPatchLevel() is changed to
conform with the BasePatchHierarchy interface, so that it now returns a
pointer to BasePatchLevel.  Lines of code such as:

   Pointer< PatchLevel<NDIM> > level_zero = hierarchy->getPatchLevel(0);

do not need to be changed.  The pointer to BasePatchLevel returned by
getPatchLevel() is cast to a pointer to PatchLevel.  However, statements such
as:

   BoxArray<NDIM> boxes = hierarchy->getPatchLevel(0)->getBoxes();

will no longer compile, because BasePatchHierarchy has no getBoxes() method.

Code such as this should be changed to first cast the pointer to the
desired PatchLevel type, then call getBoxes().

   Pointer< PatchLevel<NDIM> > level_zero = hierarchy->getPatchLevel(0);
   BoxArray<NDIM> boxes = level->getBoxes();

IMPORTANT:  Pure virtual function interfaces in TimeRefinementLevelStrategy,
StandardTagAndInitStrategy, and TagAndInitializeStrategy have been changed
to use these new abstract base classes.  Any existing user-defined classes that
are derived from these listed strategy classes must be modified to match the
new interfaces.

When these functions are changed in the user-defined classes, it will often
be necessary to add code to cast a passed-in pointer to a base class to the
desired concrete version of the class.  For example, if class Foo in a user's
code inherits from TimeRefinementLevelStrategy, then Foo must contain
an implementation of TimeRefinementLevelStrategy::getLevelDt(), which would
look something like

double Foo::getLevelDt(const tbox::Pointer< hier::BasePatchLevel<NDIM> > level,
                       const double dt_time,
                       const bool initial_time)
{
   tbox::Pointer< hier::PatchLevel<NDIM> > patch_level = level;

   . . . 

   for (hier::PatchLevel<NDIM>::Iterator p(patch_level); p; p++) {
      tbox::Pointer< hier::Patch<NDIM> > patch = patch_level->getPatch(p());

      . . .

   }

   . . . 
}

Here the casting is done at the beginning of the function, and then the
pointer 'patch_level' can be used as a usual pointer to PatchLevel.  The
casting is necessary in the this example because the patch level iterator
does not work with a pointer to BasePatchLevel, nor does BasePatchLevel
contain a getPatch() member function.

(2) Methods added to create a refined or coarsened version of an
existing patch hierarchy.  These methods are in the PatchHierarchy
class and are named makeRefinedPatchHierarchy() and
makeCoarsenedPatchHierarchy(), respectively.  Each method accept an
IntVector argument with strictly positive entries and returns a copy
of the original patch hierarchy object with each patch level refined
or coarsened by that ratio.  The new hierarchy will cover the same
physical space as the original hierarchy and will have the same number
of levels and same mapping of patches to processors on each level.
However, the index space of each level will be refined or by the
specified ratio.  Note that these operation do not allocate patch data
on the new hierarchy so this must be done by the user before any data
operations can be performed on the new hierarchy.

(3) The construction of BoundaryBox now uses a singleton class called
BoundaryLookupTable which was necessary to make SAMRAI capable of handling
spatial dimensions greater than 3.  This caused a change to the ordering
of the location indices for 3D BoundaryBox objects of codimension 2.  Users
are now given the option of using the old ordering for backward compatibility
or using the new ordering.

The original ordering, existing in versions 1.4.0 and before, was

    edge (codimension 2):
    y_lo, z_lo: 0
    y_hi, z_lo: 1
    y_lo, z_hi: 2
    y_hi, z_hi: 3
    x_lo, z_lo: 4
    x_lo, z_hi: 5
    x_hi, z_lo: 6
    x_hi, z_hi: 7
    x_lo, y_lo: 8
    x_hi, y_lo: 9
    x_lo, y_hi: 10
    x_hi, y_hi: 11

The new ordering is

    edge (codimension 2):
    x_lo, y_lo: 0
    x_hi, y_lo: 1
    x_lo, y_hi: 2
    x_hi, y_hi: 3
    x_lo, z_lo: 4
    x_lo, z_lo: 5
    x_hi, z_hi: 6
    x_hi, z_hi: 7
    y_lo, z_lo: 8
    y_hi, z_lo: 9
    y_lo, z_hi: 10
    y_hi, z_hi: 11

To choose the ordering that is desired, a boolean input keyword
'use_original_location_indices' is available in both CartesianGridGeometry
and SkeletonGridGeometry.  If set to TRUE the original ordering will be used,
and if FALSE, the new ordering is used.  The keyword is optional and will
default to TRUE if not included in input.  The keyword is irrelevant in
dimensions other than 3.

Alternatively, the static function
BoundaryLookupTable::setsetUsingOriginalLocations(bool) is available to
choose one of the two options.  This is the method to use if the user's code
uses neither the skeleton nor Cartesian grid geometry classes from SAMRAI.
This function need be only called once, assuming the user does not desire to
switch between the two ordering schemes in a single run.

(4) STL classes are now used by the SAMRAI library.  We take explicit
steps to instantiate them because SAMRAI compiles without implicit
template instantation.  Users may need to understand how this works
because it *MAY* affect users on systems where SAMRAI has not been ported.

We use STL classes minimally, where SAMRAI does not support the same
functionality.  To avoid long link times, SAMRAI is compiled with
implicit template instantiations disabled.  So, templates used by the SAMRAI
library must be explicitly instantiated.  Common templating is instantiated
by auto-generated files under the "templates/automatic*" subdirectories
of each package.  Special templates, including STL templates are
instantiated by codes in the "templates/special" subdirectories.
STL templates are instantiated in "templates/special/stl-*.C", where
"*" refers to a class (or basic type) used as the template arguments.
STL's of basic types are in the "toolbox/templates/special" while
SAMRAI-defined classes go in the package of the most dependent class.

Why do you need to know this?  Because explicit template instantiation
is not recursive.  It may be necessary to instantiate templates that
are not directly used (because they are used indirectly, by another
template class or function).  Missing symbols (often with unfamiliar
names) at link time may indicate this need.  Because indirectly used
templates are implementation-dependent, there is no a priori way to
know what they are.  If you see missing symbols that may be indirectly
used templates, you have to add explicit template instantiation code
to one or more "*/templates/special" subdirectories.  See the comments
in "source/toolbox/templates/special/stl-FundamentalTypes.C" for more
details.
