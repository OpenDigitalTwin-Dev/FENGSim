----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The filename extension for all C++ source files has been changed from
.C to .cpp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The logic surrounding the internal RAJA kernels in ArrayData has been
modified so that they can run on either the host or device, depending on
how the underlying data is allocated.

2) Usage of Umpire's deprecated DynamicPool has been replaced by QuickPool.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The filename extension for all C++ source files has been changed from
'.C' to '.cpp'.  The extension for header files remains unchanged as '.h'
so as not to require changes to `#include` lines inside user codes.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The logic surrounding the internal RAJA kernels in ArrayData has been
modified so that they can run on either the host or device, depending on
how the underlying data is allocated.

SAMRAI's core patch data types (CellData, NodeData, etc.) use ArrayData for
their underlying arrays.  When SAMRAI is built with CUDA and the RAJA
and Umpire libraries for use on GPU architectures, their constructors
can take a tbox::ResourceAllocator, which is an alias for an Umpire
allocator, to choose the memory resource where the arrays are
allocated.  In the previous release, the RAJA kernels within ArrayData that
operated on these arrays were set up to always run on the GPU device, so
the allocator must always have been for a memory resource that can run on
the device.

To give users the flexibility to choose to allocate objects of these
classes on either the host or device, the logic has been modified such that
to construct these patch data objects with a host allocator, in which case
the kernels will execute on the CPU host.

2) Usage of Umpire's deprecated DynamicPool has been replaced by QuickPool.
This is the Umpire strategy class used for SAMRAI's Umpire allocators
provided in tbox::AllocatorDatabase.
