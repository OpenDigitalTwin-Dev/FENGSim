                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

1) The class MappingConnector which is derived from Connector has been
   introduced.  The concept of a MappingConnector which is distinct from an
   OverlapConnector has always been implied but never actually introduced.  In
   places where a Connector represents a mapping a MappingConnector is now
   used.

2) Both Connector and MappingConnector hold pointers to their transposes.  Hence
   one Connector can now be used where 2--the Connector and its transpose--
   were previously required.

3) A new PatchLevel constructor which acquires a supplied BoxLevel has been
   introduced.  The existing constructor which copies a supplied BoxLevel is
   unchanged.

4) Dynamic control of refinement criteria via the following methods of
   mesh::StandardTagAndInitialize has been added:
   turnOnGradientDetector, turnOffGradientDetector,
   turnOnRichardsonExtrapolation, turnOffRichardsonExtrapolation,
   turnOnRefineBoxes, and turnOffRefineBoxes.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

1) If using PETSc, 3.2.0 is now required.

2) All injection coarsening clases are now consistently named as injections.

3) Instantiation of Connectors and BoxLevels now occurs in the methods that
   know how to build them.

4) BoxIterators are now accessed through the begin and end methods on class
   Box.  The BoxIterator constructor itself is now private.

5) Cell/Edge/Face/Node/SideIterators are now accessed through the static
   begin and end methods on Cell/Edge/Face/Node/SideGeometry respectively.
   The Iterator constructors themselves are now private.

6) BoxContainerIterator (aka BoxContainer::iterator) and
   BoxContainerConstIterator (aka BoxContainer::const_iterator) are now
   accessed through the begin and end methods on class BoxContainer.  The
   constructors for each iterator are now private.

7) The restart-redistribute tool is now parallel.

8) The input to mesh::StandardTagAndInitialize for REFINE_BOXES tagging
   criteria has been modified to support multiblock.

9) Use of class Array has been replaced throughout the library and tests with
   std::vector.

10) Access to stored Connectors has been changed.

11) TreeLoadBalancer parameter affecting number of boxes generated has changed.

12) Removed some unnecessary arguments from
    PatchLevelFillPattern::computeFillBoxesAndNeighborhoodSets().

*****************************************************************************

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Class Connector describes Box overlaps between two BoxLevels.  It
   corresponds to the OverlapConnector concept.  Class MappingConnector is
   derived from Connector and hence it also describes Box overlaps between two
   BoxLevels.  However, it describes these overlaps in a specific context--
   when the base BoxLevel has undergone a transition resulting in the head
   BoxLevel.  Hence it describes how the Boxes in the original BoxLevel (i.e.
   the base) map onto the Boxes in the modified BoxLevel (i.e. the head).

   Previously, there was no distinction between these Connector concepts.  They
   were both embodied in class Connector and there was to way to distinguish
   one from another.  Hence there was no way to ensure that any given Connector
   was being used in the proper context.

   The library now constructs and uses MappingConnectors where connectors
   describing how BoxLevels have changed are needed.  This provides both type
   safety and added clarity as to how methods taking various Connectors are to
   be used.

2) Many interfaces have been simplified as a single Connector object can now
   be used to refer to both the Connector and its transpose.  In particular,
   there is now only 1 modify method and 3 bridge methods as the other
   overloaded versions which existed were degenerate cases.  Note that in the
   case of bridgeWithNesting() and the 2 bridge() methods which create the
   result it is now necessary to specify whether or not the tranpose bridge
   should be computed.

   Several convenience methods have been added to find/create both a Connector
   and its transpose.  These are PatchHierarchy::getConnectorWithTranspose(),
   OverlapConnectorAlgorithm::findOverlapsWithTranspose(),
   PersistentOverlapConnectors::createConnectorWithTranspose(),
   PersistentOverlapConnectors::findConnectorWithTranspose(), and
   PersistentOverlapConnectors::findOrCreateConnectorWithTranspose().

3) The BoxLevel contained in a PatchLevel may not be modified.  Therefore, the
   existing PatchLevel constructor copied the supplied BoxLevel.  However, this
   means a BoxLevel copy for each PatchLevel constructed.  It the client code
   will never modify the supplied BoxLevel, it is not necessary for the new
   PatchLevel to copy the BoxLevel.  Therefore a new PatchLevel constructor has
   been introduced so that the constructed PatchLevel acquires the supplied
   BoxLevel.  To guarantee that client code does not accidentally modify the
   now shared BoxLevel, this constructor locks it so that any subsequent call
   to a non-const method on that BoxLevel results in a run-time error.  The
   library now makes use of this new PatchLevel constructor wherever possible
   to avoid the overhead of the old constructor.

   To make use of this new constructor there is are new versions of
   PatchHierarchy::makeNewPatchLevel and PatchLevelFactory::allocate.

4) The ability to dynamically control refinement criteria from an application
   has been restored.  It is still possible to statically control refinement
   criteria via an input file.  It is possible to mix static and dynamic
   control however caution should be exercised if this is done as these two
   separate controls can override one another and yield unintended behavior.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) SAMRAI has been converted to work with PETSc 3.2.0.

2) Class pdat::OuternodeDoubleConstantCoarsen has been changed to
   pdat::OuternodeDoubleInjection to be consistent with injections for other
   data centerings and types.

3) Previous practice was to instantiate Connectors and BoxLevels in high level
   library routines or client code and pass these objects through multiple
   levels of library methods to the method that ultimately knows how to build
   them.  However, until these Connectors and BoxLevels were finally built,
   they were in a very ill defined state.  This resulted in many ill defined
   objects exsiting in the code at any given time.

   Practice is now for the methods that know how to build Connectors and
   BoxLevels to also instantiate them.  Thus, boost::shared_ptrs to these
   objects are typically now created either in client code or high level
   library routines and passed along to the method that actaully instantiates
   and builds the objects.  The shared_ptrs are either null or point to fully
   constructed objects.  This results in a number of API changes in which
   Connector and BoxLevel references are replaced by shared_ptrs to Connectors
   and BoxLevels.

4) Use of BoxIterator now follows the well established pattern of requesting
   the iterator through begin and end methods on Box.  These methods are also
   simpler to use than the BoxIterator constructor which is now private.

5) Use of Cell/Edge/Face/Node/SideIterator now follows the well established
   pattern of requesting the iterators through begin and end methods.  These
   are static methods on Cell/Edge/Face/Node/SideGeometry respectively.  The
   begin and end methods are simpler to use that the iterator constructors
   which are now private.

6) Use of BoxContainerIterator and BoxContainerConstIterator now follows the
   well established pattern of requesting the iterators through begin and end
   methods on BoxContainer.  These methods are also simpler to use than the
   constructors for these iterators which are now private.

7) The restart-redistribute tool has been parallelized on the smaller of the
   number of input files and the number of output files.  You may run the
   tool with any number of processors up to the smaller of the number of
   input and the number output files.  Invocation of the tool is via mpirun
   or the appropriate parallel program launcher for your platform.  No
   arguments to the tool have changed.

8) In all previous versions of SAMRAI, input for the REFINE_BOXES tagging
   criteria consisted only of a level number and the boxes on that level.
   There was no way to specify the block these boxes come from.  The result was
   that the code read the refine boxes as being from block 0 and only that
   block.  We have expanded the input for REFINE_BOXES to include block numbers
   so that boxes from multiple blocks in any given level may be specified for
   tagging.  In addition, there was some redundancy concerning the
   specification of the level which has been removed.  Needing a level_n
   database followed by a "level" input parameter was clearly unnecessary.  See
   the docuementation for mesh::StandardTagAndInitialize for specifics of this
   new syntax.

   Any input files using REFINE_BOXES will need to be modified.

9) Class Array is essentially a vector in which the storage is reference
   counted and may be shared.  The reference counter was not thread safe
   however and there was no use anywhere in the library in which the contents
   of the Array were actually shared.  Therefore all use of Array in the
   library and tests have been converted to std::vector.  A few interfaces have
   changed and will require client code to use std::vector for arguments which
   had been Arrays.  Class Array is still part of the distribution.  However,
   we suggest that users begin to migrate their codes to use std::vector as in
   some future release Array will likely be removed.

10) In the past, in order to access persistent Connectors it was necessary to
    to chase pointers until one obtained a PersistentOverlapConnectors object.
    Now, the accessors (findConnector, findConnectorWithTranspose,
    createConnector, createConnectorWithTranspose, cacheConnector, and
    hasConnector) have been exported to classes BoxLevel and PatchLevel so
    that Connectors are accessed directly from instances of these classes.  In
    addition, BoxLevel::getPersistentOverlapConnectors() is now private and
    there is now no public interface to class PersistentOverlapConnectors as
    this class is purely an implementation detail and should not be visible to
    client code.  Hence, client code will need to be changed (simplified) to
    use the new Connector accessors in BoxLevel and PatchLevel.

    In addition to these changes, client code now specifies an action to take
    when a requested Connector is not found.  The 3 actions are
    hier::CONNECTOR_ERROR, hier::CONNECTOR_CREATE,
    and hier::CONNECTOR_IMPLICIT_CREATION_RULE.  This allows for more explicit
    and greater control of the action to take when a Connector is not found.
    One implication of this change is that findOrCreateConnector has been
    eliminated.  It's functionality is equivalent to findConnector called with
    hier::CONNECTOR_CREATE.  Clients may use
    hier::CONNECTOR_IMPLICIT_CREATION_RULE in calls to findConnector while
    developing their application and later change these when their application
    has actually stored these Connectors.

11) TreeLoadBalancer parameter affecting number of boxes generated has changed.
    TreeLoadBalancer's min_load_fraction_per_box has been removed.
    If you get too many small boxes in the hierarchy, try increasing
    TreeLoadBalancer's flexible_load_tolerance input parameter.

12) The Connector arguments of
    PatchLevelFillPattern::computeFillBoxesAndNeighborhoodSets() (a pure
    virtual method) were removed.  In most concrete implementations of
    PatchLevelFillPattern, these arguments were unneeded.  If a fill pattern
    child class does need one of these Connectors, it can be retrieved
    from the BoxLevel that is passed in.  See
    PatchLevelBorderFillPattern::computeFillBoxesAndNeighborhoodSets() for
    and example of the usage to retrieve a Connector for this purpose.
