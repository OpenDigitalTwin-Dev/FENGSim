     (notes for previous releases may be found in /SAMRAI/docs/release)

*****************************************************************************

NOTE:  These release notes are more descriptive and detailed than is usual
       for software release notes.  The reason for this is that presently
       complete documentation does not exist for most of the items listed.
       Until sufficient user documentation becomes available, descriptions
       such as those that follow will be part of SAMRAI release notes.

Please direct any questions related to these notes to the SAMRAI development
team by sending email to samrai@llnl.gov.

Where to report Bugs
--------------------

If a bug is found in the SAMRAI library, we ask that you kindly report it
to us so that we may fix it.  We will make every effort to fix bugs
in a timely manner.  Depending on the severity or the complexity of the
bug, we will either fix the bug for a subsequent library release or send
a code fix to users so that their work is minimally interrupted.

LLNL users may report bugs using the LLNL Sourceforge site if 
you have a sourceforge account:

https://sourceforge.llnl.gov/sf/tracker/do/listTrackers/projects.samrai/tracker

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) User control over SAMRAI logging.

Two new classes have been introduced to enable user control over the
logging of SAMRAI messages.  This should allow for better integration
to applications.

The tbox::Logger is a singleton class with methods to log messages.
All SAMRAI log messages are sent to this class (e.g. logWarning()
method ).  tbox::Logger delegates the mechanism of logging to the
Logger::Appender class.  Default implementations of this class are
provided to replicate previous behavior of logging to the plog stream.

The user may supply Logger::Appender implementations to direct SAMRAI
messages to a different destination, most commonly an application
specific logging mechanism.  See the
source/test/logger/userloggertest.C file for a simple example and the
Logger documentation for API information.

NOTE: The logging API in tbox::Utilities was removed.  If this was
being used the logging methods in the tbox::Logger class should be
used instead.  If the TBOX_ABORT and TBOX_WARNING macros are being
used, no changes are required.


(2) Round method added to MathUtilities class.

For portability a round method was added to the MathUtilities class
since cmath does not yet have a round method.

(3) Query function that tells location of BoundaryBox added

BoundaryBox::getBoundaryDirection enables the querying of a BoundaryBox
to determine whether the boundary box is above or below a patch in a given
coordinate direction.  It returns the enumerated type 'BoundaryDirection' which
can have the value 'LOWER', 'MIDDLE', or 'UPPER'.


(4) Capability for user to manually set decomposition and load balance of
coarsest level in a hierarchy

TimeRefinementIntegrator::initializeHierarchy now has optional arguments with
which a user can specify the decomposition and load balance of the coarsest
level of the new hierarchy.  The arguments are a BoxArray that specifies the
box decomposition of the level, and a ProcessorMapping that maps each box in
the decomposition to a processor.

(5) Additional options for writing SAMRAI restart files.

API's are supplied for writing SAMRAI restart files to a SILO file and
options have been added to enable writing SAMRAI restart information
to a file (SILO/HDF) supplied by the application.  This will enable a
SAMRAI application to store the SAMRAI specific restart data to the
applications existing file rather than creating a separate one.

See docs/userdocs/userguide.pdf for more information.

(6) Configure option for deprecated features.

The configure script option "--enable-deprecated" and
"--disable-deprecated" may be used to include/exclude deprecated
features from the build.  Deprecated features will be removed from
future SAMRAI releases; the most frequent deprecation is removal of a
method from a class.

The default is to enable deprecated features for backwards compatibility.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Building with/without extra types working again.

The SAMRAI configure script takes optional arguments to build the
template types on bool, char, float, and dcomplex:

  --enable-char           build char patch datatypes
  --enable-float          build float patch datatypes
  --enable-bool           build boolean patch datatypes
  --enable-dcomplex       build double complex patch datatypes

This feature was broken in previous releases and all the types were
built regardless of what was specified on the configure line. These
types are no longer built by default, the --enable flag for that type
is required.

The number of object files when building the default configuration was
reduced to 1544 from 2240 and the libraries were reduced to 147MB from
177MB (under Linux GNU 4.2.2).

(2) Fixed bug in KINSOL wrapper when setting MaxKrylovDimension.

Was setting setMaxIterations(d_max_krylov_dimension) when this should
have been setMaxKrylovDimension(d_max_krylov_dimension).

(3) Improved template instantiation for STL classes.

Since SAMRAI is normally compiled using explicit template
instantiation, the instantiation of the STL classes caused an
explosion of templates that were required by STL.  To address this
issue the toolbox/templates/special directory is now compiled with
implicit template instantiation.  This should eliminate a number of
problems with unresolved symbols when compiling the library.

The SAMRAI team is currently evaluating the explicit template
instantiation decision.  When this decision was originally made the
difference in compilation times was over 30 minutes.  With faster
machines and better compilers this is not as significant a problem.

(4) KAI KCC compiler code removed.

The old KAI KCC support was stripped from the configure scripts and
other files.  KCC had not been supported for some time by SAMRAI and
all references to it have been or will removed.

(5) configure and standard environment variables

Several users reported problems with configure and standard configure
environment variables (e.g. CFLAGS etc).  The SAMRAI configure script
was not including these in the Makefile.config.  The Makefile.config
should now include the flags mentioned in configure --help notes and
use them during the compilation of the library.

(6) Intel icc rpath configure improved

Intel compilation detection of shared library path syntax was improved
in autoconf.  The previous configure script was not able to determine
the syntax for including a shared library directory in the link line
(e.g. -rpath, -R etc).  This was improved so users should not have to
manually specify the syntax on the configure line in most cases.  This
was specific to the Intel icc compiler.

(7) Improved MS VC++ support.

Minor changes to code were made to enable compiling with Microsoft
Visual Studio 2008.  This is based on user submitted patches and is
not tested by the SAMRAI team.

(8) Compiling in source directory.

Configuring and compiling in the source directory should work again.
This is not the recommended compilation model, we suggest creating an
object directory and configuring/compiling in it.

(9) Calculation of timer overhead values.

The timer overhead values were hard-coded and not correct on most
machines; these values are now being computed at runtime.

(10) Nonlinear example code was not working with KINSOL and regridding.

The nonlinear example code had a problem with some smart pointer
manipulation which was causing a bug when regridding was turned on and
KINSOL was being used.

(11) KINSOL initialize method interface change.

This change only effects KINSOL users who are setting one of the
scaling vectors.

The KINSOL initialize method previously took a single argument and the
solution and residual scaling vectors were set using additional "set"
methods.  This was replaced with a single initialize method that has
two optional arguments for setting the scaling vectors.

So the following three methods:

void initialize(SundialsAbstractVector* solution);

void setSolutionScaleVector(SundialsAbstractVector* uscale);

void setResidualScaleVector(SundialsAbstractVector* fscale);

are replaced with a single initialize method of:

void initialize(SundialsAbstractVector* solution, 
     SundialsAbstractVector* uscale = NULL, 
     SundialsAbstractVector* fscale = NULL); 

(12) PETSc differencing parameter strategy default set to WP

Previous releases used the value "default" as the default value for
the differencing parameter strategy, this was changed to be the PETSc
value of MATMFFD_WP to match current PETSc API.  This can be set to
MATMFFD_DS via the setDifferencingParameterMethod method of
SNES_SAMRAIContext.  See PETSc documentation for more information on
these options.

This should not change the behavior but should remove a warning
message being generated by PETSc.

(13) Array constructor interface no longer takes optional is_standard_type flag.

The Array constructors previously had an optional flag to signal if
the templated type was one of the standard (builtin) types.  The
mechanism to determine if the templated type is a standard type was
moved inside the Array class and this flag is no longer supported.

(14) "getNumber" methods renamed to "getNumberOf"

Users reported naming differences in the methods that return the
number of something.  Both "getNumber" and "getNumberOf" were used.
The method names were changed to be "getNumberOf".

A conversion script "convert2.3" in tools/scripts/conversion2.3 will
do a text replacement of the names on a source code tree.  See the
README in the conversion2.3 directory for more information.

The following names were changed:

getNumberBlocks
getNumberBoundaryNodes
getNumberEquivalenceClasses
getNumberItems
getNumberItemsInEquivalenceClass
getNumberIterations
getNumberLevels
getNumberNearestNeighborNodes
getNumberNeighbors
getNumberOutsideNeighborNodes
getNumberRegisteredPatchDataIndices
getNumberRegisteredVariableContexts
getNumberRegisteredVariables

(15) Make tools is separated from library build.

The SAMRAI tools are built using 

make tools

instead of building automatically built with the library.  This is
currently only used to build the restart-redistribute utility.

(16) Added index operator[] to BoxArray class

The BoxArray class was using getBox() and operator "()" as operator to index.  The more
familiar "[]" operator was added.

E.G.
BoxArray<2> boxes;
boxes[0] = box;

Is more array like than the previous:

boxes(0) = box;

getBox() and operator() are deprecated and will be removed.


(17) PatchGeometry API for getting patch boundaries changed to
     get*Boundaries from get*Boundary.

SAMRAI does not have a consistent naming convention for boundary
information.  Various classes use Boundaries, Boundary, and/or
BoundaryBoxes for the same notion of a set of BoundaryBox that
describe a boundary.

PatchGeometry's API was change from get*Boundary methods to
get*Boundaries method to match other classes (e.g. CoarseFineBoundary)
as a minor step towards increasing the consistency of the names.  This
is only a partial fix for a larger naming problem.

(18) Gridding algorithm ratio_to_coarser input will fill in missing 
     values.

The array of level values for ratio_to_coarser will use the finest
value supplied for levels that are finer in the same manner as the
other gridding algorithm input.

For example:

   max_levels = 3         // Maximum number of levels in hierarchy.

   ratio_to_coarser {      // vector ratio to next coarser level
      level_1 = 4 , 4
      // all finer levels will use same values as level_0...
   }


Is the same as:

   ratio_to_coarser {      // vector ratio to next coarser level
      level_1 = 4 , 4
      level_2 = 4 , 4
   }
