                Significant bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) (v3.14.1) The CMake build system is fixed so that the -DCONDUIT_DIR flag
works correctly.  -DCONDUIT_DIR=[path] is now sufficient to enable building
with Conduit, assuming that [path] is the location of a valid Conduit
installation.

2) (v3.14.1) Internal fixes have been implemented to avoid a duplicate
definition of a #define macro that was defined by SAMRAI's build system but
also is common in users' application codes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) A new CMake-based build system has been added.  The previous autoconf-based
system still works as well.

2) tbox::ConduitDatabase is a new concrete implementation of
tbox::Database that uses the Conduit library (https://github.com/LLNL/conduit)
to store its data.  Conduit is a new optional dependency for SAMRAI.

3) A new method createBlueprintDatabase in PatchHierarchy provides a way to
create a code-portable description of a SAMRAI hierarchy using the Conduit
Blueprint protocols.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Classes that use PETSc and Sundials have been updated to work with
newer versions of these libraries.

2) Support for PT-Scotch as a third-party library has been removed, and
the GraphLoadBalancer class that relied on this library has been removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) A new CMake-based build system has been added.  The previous autoconf-based
system still works as well.  We intend to transition fully to the CMake system
in future releases.

The new system uses CMake (https://cmake.org) supplemented with the BLT macro
library (https://github.com/LLNL/blt).  See INSTALL-NOTES-CMAKE for more
information.

2) tbox::ConduitDatabase is a new concrete implementation of
tbox::Database that uses the Conduit library (https://github.com/LLNL/conduit)
to store its data.  Conduit is a new optional dependency for SAMRAI.

When SAMRAI is built with Conduit, tbox::Database also has a method to write
out its data into an instance of Conduit's native data structure,
conduit::Node.

3) A new method createBlueprintDatabase in PatchHierarchy provides a way to
create a code-portable description of a SAMRAI hierarchy using the Conduit
Blueprint protocols.

createBlueprintDatabase creates as much of the Blueprint as possible from
evaluating the PatchHierarchy, and then uses classes BlueprintUtils and
BlueprintUtilsStrategy to bring in application-specific information.  See
the Doxygen documenation for more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Classes that use PETSc and Sundials have been updated to work with
newer versions of these libraries.  SAMRAI is now compatible with PETSc
version 3.10.5 and Sundials version 4.1.0.

2) Support for PT-Scotch as a third-party library has been removed, and
the GraphLoadBalancer class that relied on this library has been removed.
This was never more than an experimental feature, and we decided not to
continue support.
