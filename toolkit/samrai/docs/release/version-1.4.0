                    Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed 
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) GNU C++ 3.2 and 3.3 support was added.

(2) The configure script no longer looks for the KCC compiler by default.  
It must be explicitly specified in the configure as "--with-CXX=KCC".

(3) Minor changes to case of configure options to make them consistent
(e.g. --with-TAU is now --with-tau)

(4) To accommodate the new Vizamrai vector plotting capabilities 
(see what's new below), the registration routines in the Vizamrai data 
writer class have changed. 

(5) The implementation of hier_PatchLevelX::Iterator was changed to
improve efficiency.

(6) A floating point precision argument was added to print routines for
all array-based patch data types.

(7) A floating point precision argument was added to print routines for
statistic and statistician.

(8) All input entries supplied to the "SAMRAIManager {...}" input section 
should now be supplied by the "GlobalInputs{...}" input entry.  The 
SAMRAIManager::getFromInput() is no longer needed. 

(9) Copy operations were filled in outerface and outerside data to copy from 
side to outerside and face to outerface directly.

(10) The interfaces of two methods in the HyperbolicLevelIntegrator class
have changed:  getLevelDt() and initializeLevelIntegrator().

(11) Additional arguments were added to the interfaces of three methods 
of the GriddingAlgorithm: makeFinerLevel(), regridAllFinerLevels(), and 
regridFinerLevel().   

(12) Changes were made to the mesh_TagAndInitializeStrategy and 
mesh_StandardTagAndInitialize classes to incorporate dynamic refinement
based on user-specified boxes (see item 5 in what's new below) and to 
fix some problems in the Richardson extrapolation algorithm. 

(13) Made changes to SAMRAIVectorReal math operations to extend to ghost
cells: the bool interior_only argument is added to many operations,
defaulting to false (the old behavior).

(14) Modified the VizamraiDerivedDataStrategy to support both
Vizamrai and VisIt data formats.  See item 7 under what's new.

(15) The constructors for the Euler, LinAdv, and ConvDiff example
applications have been modified.  They no longer take a CartesianVizamraiDataWriter
object as an argument.  Rather, users explicitly register either a Vizamrai
and/or VisIt data writer so that either package, or both, may be
used to write visualization data. 

(16) Support for PETSc-2.1.6.  Interoperation with older PETSc versions
may or may not work.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed 
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) Vector data can be written to visualization files.

(2) Some new methods were added to the solv_PoissonHierarchySolver and 
solv_PoissonHYPRESolver classes.

(3) For consistency with the xfer_RefinePatchStrategyX class, the pure virtual
function getCoarsenOpStencilWidth() was added to the xfer_CoarsenPatchStrategyX
class.

(4) Routines have been added to the refine algorithm/schedule classes and the
coarsen algorithm/schedule classes that allow one to reset the data transfer
transactions in a previously created schedule to operate on different patch
data objects without recomputing the communication schedules.

(5) The capability for the user to specify dynamic refinement with
prescribed boxes was added. A new input format is required for this 
added capability - see the mesh_TagAndInitializeStrategyX.h for a 
description and example of the new format.  Although users are encouraged 
to start using the new format, the old input format for static refine boxes 
is also supported.

(6) New cell-centered Poisson solvers are in sources/solvers/poisson.
These use second-order, central-differences and support Robin boundary
conditions which can be specialized to Neumann and Dirichlet bc's.
The multi-level solver uses the FAC algorithm in sources/solvers/FAC.
Users are encouraged to use these solvers instead of older ones in
source/solvers/OLD.FAC.  In the next release, the solvers in OLD.FAC
will be removed!

(7) Support for the VisIt visualization package has been added 
through the VisItDataWriter class.  Use of this class is very similar
to the CartesianVizamraiDataWriter.

(8) Basic communication functionality for multiblock domains has been added
for 2D problems only.

(9) Uniform and nonuniform load balance capabilities have been rewritten.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) GNU C++ 3.2 and 3.3 support was added.  Some minor fixes where needed to 
suppress warning messages and complex template functions where not being 
instantiated.

(2) 

(3)

(4) To accommodate the new Vizamrai vector plotting capabilities, the
registration routines in the Vizamrai data writer class have changed.
The current set of routines are registerPlotScalar()/registerPlotVector()
and registerDerivedPlotScalar()/registerDerivedPlotVector() for scalar/vector
regular and derived plot quantities, respectively.   Registration of 
plot quantities is essentially the same as before except that the new 
function names must be used.  

The argument list for the user-supplied function writeDerivedDataToStream()
has changed to accommodate vector data (see appu_VizamraiDerivedDataStrategyX 
class header documentation).  Users wishing to write out their own scalar 
quantities can proceed as before.  When writing derived vector data, 
each vector component must be written out separately on the box region; 
e.g., all component zero values on the box, then all component one values 
on the box, and so on.

See the document Vizamrai-writer.pdf in the SAMRAI/docs/userdocs directory
for more details.  Also, consult the Euler sample application where total 
momentum has been added as a plot quantity to illustrate the generation of a 
derived vector quantity.  

(5)

(6) A floating point precision argument was added to print routines for
all array-based patch data types.  If no argument is provided to the print 
calls, the default setting is in effect.  This is 12 decimal places for
double and complex types and 6 decimal places for float types.  The argument
is ignored for other types.

(7) A floating point precision argument was added to print routines for
statistic and statistician.  If no argument is provided to the print
calls, the default setting is in effect which is is 12 decimal places.

(8) In versions 1.3.1 and before, users could supply certain globally
applicable inputs to the SAMRAIManager by adding a "SAMRAIManager{...}"
entry to their input file, and adding SAMRAIManager::getFromInput()
to their main code.  We made some changes to eliminate the 2nd step by
moving the functionality to the InputManager.  Since it was 
counter-intuitive to have InputManager read SAMRAIManager input,
we changed the lookup name to "GlobalInputs".  The only change the user 
must should see is it will be necessary to replace any instances of 
"SAMRAIManager{...}" input entries in input files from v1.3.1 and before
with "GlobalInputs{...}". The names of the input entries inside the
GlobalInputs{} database will be the same as the former SAMRAIManager{}.

(9)

(10) The HyperbolicLevelIntegrator::getLevelDt() method no longer takes 
"recompute_dt" as one of its arguments.  In versions 1.3.1 and before,
this flag could be set false and the dt would be accessed from the 
TimeRefinementIntegrator.  We removed the pointer to the TRI from the
HLI because it created strange dependencies.  With this change, the
initializeLevelIntegrator() method no longer takes a 
pointer to the time refinement integrator as one of its arguments.

(11) Additional arguments were added to the interfaces of three methods 
of the GriddingAlgorithm: makeFinerLevel(), regridAllFinerLevels(), and 
regridFinerLevel().  The added arguments supply time information that
is used in the Richardson extrapolation algorithm and the defaulted
arguments can be ignored if not using this algorithm.

(12) A number of changes were made to the mesh_TagAndInitializeStrategy 
and mesh_StandardTagAndInitialize classes.  First, static refine box 
specification was moved from StandardTagAndInitialize to the 
TagAndInitializeStrategy.  Support for dynamic refinement with user-specified 
boxes was added.  See item 5 in what's new above for more information.  
Second, the interfaces to tagCellsForRefinement() and 
preprocessErrorEstimation() were modified to add the "regrid_start_time" 
argument.  This is used for only Richardson extrapolation and is defaulted 
zero for cases where Richardson extrapolation is not used.  

(13)

(14) The VizamraiDerivedDataStrategy class was renamed to 
"VisDerivedDataStrategy" so that it may support both Vizamrai
and VisIt data formats.  Within this class, the method name
"writeDerivedDataToStream()" was also changed.  Instead of 
writing to a stream (which was not a recognized format in VisIt), 
it now packs data to a double buffer (*dbuffer). To avoid confusion,
the method name was changed to "packDerivedDataIntoDoubleBuffer()".
Also, the return type was changed from void to bool; the boolean
return value specifies whether derived data exists on the patch
or not, providing the capability to write out data on selected
patches.

The functionality of the new method is largely the same.  Generally,
the way this method was used in the past was 1) create a temporary 
double or float buffer, 2) fill the buffer with data, 3) pack the 
buffer into the stream.  The new functionality eliminates steps 1 
and 3. It operates only on double data so the user does not have 
to determine which type to write to. Also, it supports both
the CartesianVizamraiDataWriter and the VisItDataWriter classes
so the user does not have to inheret from two classes and supply 
two different methods. See the SAMRAI/examples/Euler case for an 
example implementation. 

(15) The constructors for the Euler, LinAdv, and ConvDiff example
applications have been modified.  They no longer take a CartesianVizamraiDataWriter
object as an argument.  The reason for this modification is that we've
added support for VisIt (see item 7) and we wanted to provide the
capability for users to use either Vizamrai, VisIt, or both to the
applications codes.  Thus, instead of passing in a writer to the
application, we added the methods "registerVizamraiDataWriter()" 
and "registerVisItDataWriter()" which allow the user to register
the data writer(s) they would like to used.  The old functionality:

   Euler* euler = new Euler(name, input_db, viz_writer);

which passed in a CartesianVizamraiDataWriter object to the 
constructor can be duplicated by simply registering the viz writer
after the object is constructed:

   Euler* euler = new Euler(name, input_db);
   euler->registerVizamraiDataWriter(viz_writer);

If you prefer to use VisIt, simply register a VisItDataWriter object
instead.  You can also register both, in which case both Vizamrai
and VisIt data will be written.  See the SAMRAI/examples/Euler 
application for example usage. 

(16) Support for PETSc-2.1.6.  Interoperation with older PETSc versions
may or may not work.  To enable interoperation with PETSc's SNES
class, PETSc-2.1.6 is required.  Older PETSc versions may work but
are not guaranteed and not supported.  (The SNES class from older
versions definitely will NOT work.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Vectors data can be written to visualization files.  The SAMRAI
viz writer class has a new method call (registerPlotVector) which adds
a vector quantity, it looks just like the existing method call but you
don't specify the depth.  As an example you used to have to do this:

d_viz_writer->registerPlotVariable("X Velocity",
                                    vardb->mapVariableAndContextToIndex(
                                    d_velocity, d_plot_context),
                                    0);
d_viz_writer->registerPlotVariable("Y Velocity",
                                    vardb->mapVariableAndContextToIndex(
                                    d_velocity, d_plot_context),
                                    1);

Now you can do this:

d_viz_writer->registerPlotVector("Velocity",
                                  vardb->mapVariableAndContextToIndex(
                                  d_velocity, d_plot_context));

This will write out all of the components of the velocity.  Vector data
can be viewed using the Vizamrai tool in two different ways, either as 
individual scalar components (as before) or as a vector field.  See the
Vizamrai interface for more information.

(2) The following new methods were added to the PoissonHierarchySolver 
class:
       double solv_PoissonHierarchySolver::getConvergenceError()
       double solv_PoissonHierarchySolver::getConvergenceRate()

to return the convergence error and rate of the solve.  The following
new methods were added to the PoissonHYPRESolver to allow the user
to set the number of pre and post relax steps for the HYPRE solve:

       void solv_PoissonHYPRESolver::setNumPreRelaxSteps(int steps)
       void solv_PoissonHYPRESolver::setNumPostRelaxSteps(int steps)
       int  solv_PoissonHYPRESolver::getNumPreRelaxSteps()
       int  solv_PoissonHYPRESolver::getNumPostRelaxSteps()

If these methods are not called, one pre and post relax step is used, 
which is the default behavior from previous SAMRAI versions. Also,
to assist in debugging the HYPRE solves, the following method was
added: 

       void solv_PoissonHYPRESolver::setPrintSolverInfo(bool print)

If "print" is true, it invokes HYPRE's print methods to dump matrix
and right-hand-side information to file.  See the header comments
for more information. 

(3) For consistency with the xfer_RefinePatchStrategyX class, the pure virtual
function getCoarsenOpStencilWidth() was added to the xfer_CoarsenPatchStrategyX
class.  The returned hier_IntVectorX indicates the maximum stencil width of the 
user-defined coarsen operations implemented by the class derived from 
xfer_CoarsenPatchStrategyX.

(4) Routines have been added to the refine algorithm/schedule classes and the
coarsen algorithm/schedule classes that allow one to reset the data transfer
transactions in a previously created schedule to operate on different patch
data objects without recomputing the communication schedules.  This functionality
is particularly useful for making multiple data communication operations much more
efficient when similar data is moved during each communication phase since the
data communication dependencies in the schedule do not have to be recomputed.

An example of how this functionality is used with refine algorithms/schedules
is as follows (coarsen algorithm/schedule functionality is similar):

   // Create refine algorithm object
   xfer_RefineAlgorithm my_algorithm;

   // Register some data transfer operations with the algorithm
   my_algorithm.registerRefine(my_dst0, my_src0, my_scratch0, my_refop0);
   my_algorithm.registerRefine(my_dst1, my_src1, my_scratch1, my_refop1); 
   // etc....

   // Create communication schedule
   tbox_Pointer<xfer_RefineSchedule> my_schedule = my_algorithm.createSchedule(...);

   // Move data with the schedule
   my_schedule->fillData(...);


   // Standard usage of refine algorithm/schedule classes is illustrated up
   // to this point.  Now suppose that we want to perform similar data 
   // communication operations on a different set of patch data components
   // where the operations have identical data communication patters as before.
   // Instead of creating a new refine schedule that would only differ from
   // my_schedule in the specific patch data components that are treated,
   // we can now simply reconfigure the existing schedule with a new set of
   // operations as follows:

   // Create a new refine algorithm object
   xfer_RefineAlgorithm my_new_algorithm;
   
   // Register a set of data transfer operations with the new algorithm.
   // Note that these registrations must be performed in the same order
   // as before and each registration call must involve patch data and
   // refine operator objects that have identical structure as the previous
   // sequence of registrations (i.e., same patch data type, same ghost cell
   // widths, same operator stencil widths, etc.).
   my_new_algorithm.registerRefine(my_new_dst0, my_new_src0, 
                                   my_new_scratch0, my_new_refop0);
   my_new_algorithm.registerRefine(my_new_dst1, my_new_src1, 
                                   my_new_scratch1, my_new_refop1);
   // etc....

   // Reconfigure the existing schedule for the new operations
   my_new_algorithm.resetSchedule(my_schedule);

   // Move the new data with the schedule
   my_schedule->fillData(...);

   // To reset the schedule to its original state, simply reconfigure it again...
   my_algorithm.resetSchedule(my_schedule);

(6) There a new Poisson level solver (solv_CellPoissonHypreSolverX),
a new Poisson multi-level solver (solv_CellPoissonFACSolverX) and a
new class (solv_RobinBcCoefStrategyX) to support boundary conditions
for these solvers and to help maintain consistency between the solvers
when they work together.

Both solvers solve the general equation
     div(D * grad(u)) + C*u = f
where u, f and C are cell-centered data, and D is side-centered data.
In addition, C and D may also be set to constants.

The level solver uses hypre to solve the linear system.
The multi-level solver uses the FAC algorithm.  Both are documented
in the docs/userdocs directory.

These solvers superceed the solvers in OLD.FAC, whose use is now
discouraged.

(7) Support for VisIt data has been added through the 
VisItDataWriter class.  This class supports a number of new features,
including node-centered data, moving node (i.e. ALE) data, data
defined only on specific patches, and parallelism in visualization
postprocessing.  Use of the VisIt data writer is very similar to the
CartesianVizamraiDataWriter.  See the document 
SAMRAI/docs/userdocs/visit-writer.pdf for more information about
the VisitDataWriter.  Also, the Euler, LinAdv, and ConvDiff applications
codes have been modified to use the Vizamrai and/or VisIt data 
writers.  See the source code in these applications for example
usage.

(8) 2D Multiblock communication functionality has been added in a new package
with classes having the prefix "mblk."  This is still in a very preliminary
stage of development and may not yet be useful for significant problems.

(9) Uniform and nonuniform load balance capabilities have been rewritten.
The changes enhance the performance of these routines and also increase 
flexibility of use.  For example, one can now choose a different load balancing 
scheme for each level in an AMR hierarchy.  Please see the documentation for 
the load balance classes for more details.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Major Bug Fixes 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Fix to communication schedule construction.  There was a bug in    
the more efficient schedule construction algorithms, released in v1.3.1,
which caused problems when patches of the same level were closer in 
proximity to one another than their ghost fill width.  This should now
be fixed.

(2) Fix to synchronized time stepping.  The synchronized time-stepping 
algorithm was not properly updating solutions on coarser grid levels, and
could cause memory allocation problems. The algorithm was re-structured to
avoid this problem.
