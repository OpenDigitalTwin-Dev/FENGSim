 * to a Qt client without losing or adding false information by going
 * through wl_seat and wl_keyboard.
 *
 * Note: This protocol is considered private to Qt. We will do our
 * best to bump version numbers when we make backwards compatible
 * changes, bump the protocol name and interface suffixes when we make
 * backwards incompatible changes, but we provide no guarantees. We
 * may also remove the protocol without warning. Implement this at
 * your own risk.
