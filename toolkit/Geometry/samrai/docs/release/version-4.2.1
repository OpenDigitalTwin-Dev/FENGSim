VERSION 4.2.1

Version 4.2.1 is a minor patch release to make SAMRAI compatible with 
Umpire v2023.06.0 and RAJA v2023.06.0.  The content of the release notes
file for SAMRAI version 4.2.0 is preserved here, except for notes marked
as version 4.2.1


VERSION 4.2.0

Version 4.2.0 is considered a beta release due to the introduction of
kernel fusion features which may see notable changes in future releases.


*****************************************************************************

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Significant bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) A bug in the internal computation of connector widths in
TimeRefinementIntegrator was fixed.  There was an incorrect computation of
connector width between adjacent levels when a large tag buffer size was
provided to the input.  This computation has been fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) RAJA-based kernel fusion features have been added, allowing for independent
GPU kernels to be accumulated for a single kernel launch.

2) A minimum_patch_load parameter has been added to CascadePartitioner and
TreeLoadBalancer as an option to change how small patches are treated during
load balancing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) VERSION 4.2.1 Minor changes have been made for compatibility with RAJA
v2023.06.0 and Umpire v2023.06.0, and those are the recommended releases
for those libraries for use with this SAMRAI release.

                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) RAJA-based kernel fusion features have been added, allowing for independent
GPU kernels to be accumulated for a single kernel launch.

The core of these features are in the new tbox::KernelFuser class, which uses
RAJA WorkGroup features to enqueue a set of independent kernels that have been
defined as lambda functions in RAJA for_alls.  Rather than executing each
kernel on the GPU device when it is reached in the code, the kernels are
stored until the KernelFuser object makes a launch() call, at which time all
kernels are executed concurrently.  The intent of this is to reduce the
overhead from launching each kernel separately.

To support usage of kernel fusion, a new abstract base class
tbox::ScheduleOpsStrategy has been added, with methods that are called from
tbox::Schedule at places where it could be useful for applications to make
calls for kernel fusion operations in their codes.  In particular, the calls
to postPack(), postCopy(), and postUnpack() are provided so that
applications can implement calls to kernel fusion launches after the original
calls to data packing, copy, and unpacking operations have enqueued rather
than launched the kernels that do those operations.  ScheuduleOpsStrategy
is defined generally without reference to kernel fusion, as applications
could choose to implement other things for their codes to do before and after
Schedule operations.  A pointer to a ScheduleOpsStrategy can be provided
using set methods available in RefineSchedule, CoarsenSchedule, or Schedule.

2) A minimum_patch_load parameter has been added to CascadePartitioner and
TreeLoadBalancer as an option to change how small patches are treated during
load balancing.

The value given for minimum_patch_load is used to "fool" the load balancing
algorithm into treating small patches with a cell count below the given value
as if they were the size of the given value.  This can reduce the likelihood
that the load balancers will accumulate a large number of small patches on
on a single rank, with a known side effect being that the decomposition will
have less uniformity in total cell count on each processor.  This is provided
as an option for users running in environments where uniformity in patch
count may be more desired than uniformity in cell count.

3) VERSION 4.2.1 Minor changes have been made for compatibility with RAJA
v2023.06.0 and Umpire v2023.06.0, and those are the recommended releases
for those libraries for use with this SAMRAI release.
