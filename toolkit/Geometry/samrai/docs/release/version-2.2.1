                     Release Notes for SAMRAI v2.2.1
     (notes for previous releases may be found in /SAMRAI/docs/release)
*****************************************************************************

NOTE:  These release notes are more descriptive and detailed than is usual
       for software release notes.  The reason for this is that presently
       complete documentation does not exist for most of the items listed.
       Until sufficient user documentation becomes available, descriptions
       such as those that follow will be part of SAMRAI release notes.

Please direct any questions related to these notes to the SAMRAI development
team by sending email to samrai@llnl.gov.

LLNL users can use the discussion groups on the LLNL Sourceforge site:

Where to report Bugs
--------------------

If a bug is found in the SAMRAI library, we ask that you kindly report it
to us so that we may fix it.  We will make every effort to fix bugs
in a timely manner.  Depending on the severity or the complexity of the
bug, we will either fix the bug for a subsequent library release or send
a code fix to users so that their work is minimally interrupted.

LLNL users may report bugs using the LLNL Sourceforge site if 
you have a sourceforge account:

https://sourceforge.llnl.gov/sf/tracker/do/listTrackers/projects.samrai/tracker

Bugs found by other users should send email to samrai-bugs@llnl.gov.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) The fill_time argument was removed from the interface for
RobinBcCoefStrategy::setBCCoefs(). 
 
(2) The VisItDataWriter was modified to allow for the writing of data in
VisIt's sparse volume fraction format for mixed cells. 

(3) Added tolerance for LoadBalancer.

(4) Added LC "uP" machine to supported configurations.

(5) Added limited Mac OS X support.

(6) Bug fixes

                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The fill_time argument was removed from the interface for
RobinBcCoefStrategy::setBcCoefs().  As this is a pure virtual function,
several classes in source/solvers/poisson that inherit from
RobinBcCoefStrategy inherited this change in their implementations of
setBcCoefs().

(2) The VisItDataWriter was modified to allow for the writing of data in
VisIt's sparse volume fraction format for mixed cells.  This means that
it is now possible to write data for cells that contain mixed materials
so that the state of each material can be represented separately within
a cell when viewed through VisIt.  VisIt versions 1.7.1 and later are
capable of reading files that are dumped using this functionality.

(3) A tolerance value was added to the LoadBalancer to allow a user
settable tolerance in the comparisons of the computed box workload to
computed ideal workload.  This enables addition control over when boxes
are split.  Previously a box was split when

( box_workload <= ideal_workload )

which results in boxes being chopped up even when very near the ideal
workload, the tolerance value is used to allow for some user specified
deviation from the ideal workload:

( box_workload <= ( (1. + workload_tolerance) * ideal_workload ) )

a workload_tolerance of 0.0 (the default) retains the previous
behavior.  

The workload tolerance can be changed by setting the
"workload_tolerance" in the LoadBalancer input.

(4) Minor changes where made to fix compilation and linking issues
with the IBM xlc compilers for the Livermore Computing "uP" machine.

artf7701

(5) Fixed problems identified by Kevin Chu when compiling on Mac OS X.
Configure scripts should better identify OS X and fixed several small
code issues.

NOTE: The SAMRAI team has limited access to a Mac so this port has
very limited support from our team.  We do try to encorporate user
supplied fixes for bugs and porting issues.

artf7714

(6) The following additional bug fixes from sourceforge were fixed:

Restart-redistribute utilty caused a compilation error when compiling without HDF.  artf7667

Guards for inline control where incorrect and caused problem when users were including SAMRAI files.  artf7690

Intel remark messages were showing potential problems when compiling.
Examined and fixed or ignored serious problems.  Some remarks are
being ignored since they are not problems. artf7680
