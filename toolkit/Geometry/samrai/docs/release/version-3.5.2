                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

1) The BoxOverlap classes provided by SAMRAI (CellOverlap, NodeOverlap, etc.)
   now have "getSourceBoxContainer" methods to get a representation of the
   overlap boxes in the index space of the source box of a transaction.

2) FirstLayerEdgeFillPattern and FirstLayerSideFillPattern added.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

1) Input for StandardTagAndInitialize has changed to allow for more flexible
   tagging criteria.

2) fillSingularityBoundaryConditions moved from RefinePatchStrategy
   to new SingularityPatchStrategy class.

3) Input parameters are more completely and accurately documented.

4) A more self consistent model for the handling of input parameters has been
   implemented particularly how input and restart databases interact.  In
   addition, more error and sanity checking has been added to the parsing of
   input databases for all classes.

                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The BoxOverlap classes provided by SAMRAI (CellOverlap, NodeOverlap, etc.)
   now have "getSourceBoxContainer" methods to get a representation of the
   overlap boxes in the index space of the source box of a transaction.

   The overlap classes hold a container of Boxes and a Transformation object
   representing a transformation between source and destination index spaces
   for a transaction.  The Boxes are represented in the destination index
   space, that is they exist where they are after the Transformation has been
   invoked.  getSourceBoxContainer() provides a way to obtain a representation
   of these Boxes in the source index space before the Boxes are transformed.

   These are mainly useful for overlaps that are used for data transactions
   at block boundaries of multiblock meshes.  The overlap object stores the
   Boxes in terms of the destination block, while getSourceBoxContainer allows
   a user to obtain a represenation of the same Boxes in terms of the source
   block.

2) FirstLayerEdgeFillPattern and FirstLayerSideFillPattern added.

   These implementations of VariableFillPattern allow transactions to be
   constructed to communicate EdgeData or SideData only at positions along
   the boundary of a Patch.

                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) In earlier versions of SAMRAI it was only possible to specify that the
   Richardson extrapolation or gradient detector tagging criteria would take
   effect at a particular time or cycle and remain in effect for all later
   times/cycles.  One could also specify specific boxes to refine by level at
   at specific times or cycles.  It is now possible to apply any combination
   of these criteria at any time or cycle.  In particular, Richardson
   extrapolation and gradient detector criteria may be turned on and off at
   will in conjunction with tagging of specific boxes on specific levels.
   To support this the input syntax for the StandardTagAndInitialize class
   has changed.  The general form of this class' input is now:
   at_0 {
      cycle | time = int | double
      tag_0 {
         tagging_method = RICHARDSON_EXTRAPOLATION | GRADIENT_DETECTOR |
                          REFINE_BOXES
         level_0 {
            // Needed if tagging_method is REFINE_BOXES
            level = int
            boxes = array of boxes
         }
         ...
         level_k {
         }
      }
      ...
      tag_j {
      }
   }
   ...
   at_i {
   }

   A simple shortcut syntax exists for the simplest cases of GRADIENT_DETECTOR
   or RICHARDSON_EXTRAPOLATION applied at cycle 0 onward.  The syntax of this
   shortcut is unchanged from earlier version of SAMRAI and has the form:
   tagging_method = RICHARDSON_EXTRAPOLATION | GRADIENT_DETECTOR

   See the header for StandardTagAndInitialize for more details.

2) fillSingularityBoundaryConditions moved from RefinePatchStrategy
   to new SingularityPatchStrategy class.

   The fillSingularityBoundaryConditions method is only used for multiblock
   configurations with at least one singularity.  If you have such a
   configuration, you must inherit SingularityPatchStrategy in the class
   where you inheritted RefinePatchStrategy.  See the SingularityPatchStrategy
   and RefinePatchStrategy class documentations.  If you don't have block
   singularities, you need not change anything.

3) Each class which accepts input parameters now documents those input
   parameters via the code's doxygen source code documentation.  This
   documentation is downloadable or may be generated from the source code
   distribution.  Included in the documentation of each parameter is:
   definition, data type, default value (if any), legal range, whether the
   parameter is optional or required, and how the parameter behaves on restart.

4) For a complete description of SAMRAI's input paramters handling refer to
   a new user document, docs/userdocs/InputParametersAndRestart.pdf.
