                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) It is now permitted to set up hierarchies with anisotropic refinement
ratios on multiblock geometries with irregular connectivity. This is mainly
handle through changes to IntVector described in "what's changed".

2) A new feature allows user-defined gradient detector tag values to be saved
and retrieved during or after regridding.

3) A more scalable partitioner, CascadePartitioner was added, and
TileClustering was improved.  Both of these should scale well to
1M+ MPI tasks.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) There have been changes to IntVector to allow it to hold different values
on different blocks.  IntVector now holds a value for a number of
blocks.  There should be no impact on usage in application codes that use only
single-block meshes.

2) Index is no longer a child class derived from IntVector.

3) For type-safety reasons, the block number held by BlockId now is expressed
as having type BlockId::block_t.

                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  It is now permitted to set up hierarchies with anisotropic refinement
ratios on multiblock geometries with irregular connectivity. This is mainly
handle through changes to IntVector described in "what's changed".

Previously all multiblock meshes were required to use the same refinement ratio
on all blocks, which made it impossible to use anistropic ratios in any case
that had axis rotations between neighboring blocks.  Users are now allowed to
define different refinement ratios on each block, though they must take care
to keep the ratios consistent at block boundaries.

2) A new feature allows user-defined gradient detector tag values to be saved
and retrieved during or after regridding.

Previously, when application codes set their tag values in a user-defined
implementation of StandardTagAndInitStrategy::applyGradientDetector(), any
possible integer value was technically valid, but the values were treated by
SAMRAI's gridding and box generation algorithms as effectively boolean--nonzero
values tagged the cells for refinement, and zero values meant the cells were
untagged.  Furthermore, there was no way for application codes to see that
data once they passed it back to SAMRAI--it was used to generate new grids and
then deallocated.

Now application codes, may, if desired, set their tag values to any nonzero
value and they will have a way to retrieve those values for their own
analysis.  SAMRAI will internally still treat the tag values as effectively
boolean, but the application will be able to use distinguish different reasons
that particular cells were tagged, which may be analyzed for reasons such
as debugging or visualization.

There are two ways provided to retrieve those values, both by implementing a
virtual method in StandardTagAndInitStrategy to define a callback into the
application code.

 - The first, getUserTagData, provides a means to retrieve the tag data
   on the level where the tags were originally defined.  The callback occurs
   during regridding, before the tagged level may be regridded and destroyed.

 - The second, checkNewLevelTagData, provides a representation of the tag
   data on a new level after it is created.  The new level was created based
   on tags on a coarser level, and those tag values are filled onto the new
   level and can be seed during a callback that occurs after the new level
   is fully initialized.  This callback can only be used if the boolean
   input argument "d_save_tag_data" is set to true in the GriddingAlgorithm
   input.  This feature adds communication overhead, so it should only be
   turned on if it is really desired. 

3) A more scalable partitioner, CascadePartitioner was added, and
TileClustering was improved.  Both of these should scale well to
1M+ MPI tasks.

CascadePartitioner can be used wherever a LoadBalanceStrategy is
needed.  TileClustering can be used wherever BoxGeneratorStrategy is
needed.  They can be drop-in replacements for what you are using in
the GriddingAlgorithm.  See the class documentation.  The algorithms
are described in the article "Advances in Patch-Based Adaptive Mesh
Refinement Scalability" submitted to JPDC.  Scaling benchmark results
are also in the article.

Tiling generates clusters of a predetermined tile size.  Tile size can
be different on different levels, and mixing tiled and untiled levels
is permitted.  However, tiling is most efficient when tile boundaries
coincide, which is achieved by when Tc*R is divisible by Tf or vice
versa, where Tc is the tile size on a coarser level, Tf is the tile
size on the finer level and R is the refinement ratio between the two
levels.  Be sure to use a compatible tile size in the partitioning
object.

                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) There have been changes to IntVector to allow it to hold different values
on different blocks.  IntVector now holds a value for a number of
blocks.  There should be no impact on usage in application codes that use only
single-block meshes.

The purpose of this change is to allow for the IntVector to hold differing
values on different blocks for things such as refinement ratios and connector
widths.  This makes it possible to set up multiblock hierarchies with
anisotropic refinement ratios.

IntVectors created in a multiblock problem will have a number of blocks as
part of their state, which can be queried with the method getNumBlocks().  The
number of blocks will be either the number of blocks in the mesh, or one.  The
data held by IntVector will be of length equal to the product of the number of
blocks and the number of dimentions.

The operator[] to access a single integer value from and IntVector now only
works when the number of blocks for the IntVector is one.  To access a single
integer value from a multiblock IntVector, use the operator() with two
arguments, one for a block number and one for a dimensional value.


2) Index is no longer a child class derived from IntVector.  It is now its own
self-contained class.  There should be little to no effect on application code
usage, unless codes were using the two classes interchangeably.  Both Index
and IntVector have constructors allowing users to construct objects of one
class from input of the other.


3) For type-safety reasons, the block number held by BlockId now is expressed
as having type BlockId::block_t.  It can be treated like an unsigned int.
