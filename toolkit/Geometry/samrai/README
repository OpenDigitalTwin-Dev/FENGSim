Building SAMRAI using CMake:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../
    make

Third-party libraries will be detected by CMake based on what is in your path.
On LC systems, the `use` command should set the right environment variables.
Alternatively, you can use `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to point CMake at the locations
of the libraries. The only required library is boost. HDF5 is enabled by
default but can be turned off by passing the argument `-DENABLE_HDF5=Off` to
CMake.  More extensive instructions on building and installing SAMRAI using
CMake are available in the INSTALL-NOTES file.
