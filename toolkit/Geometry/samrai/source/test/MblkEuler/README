#########################################################################

This README explains how to compile and run the Multiblock Euler 
application.  The files in this directory are as follows:

    main.cpp               -  application driver program
    MblkEuler.[C,h]      -  C++ class containing routines specific to the
                            Euler example and which are called from
                            SAMRAI AMR library routines
    MblkGeometry.[C,h]   -  Class managing the physical coordinate geometry
                            of the problem.
    boundaryconditions.f -  Fortran implementation of some boundary
                            conditions code
    bccommon.f           -  Defines some fortran constants used in
                            boundarycondistions.f
    MblkEulerFort.h      -  Header file defining external fortran routines 

This example is similar to the single-block Euler sample application.
This example has the following differences:

   1. It works on non-cartesian mapped grids 
   2. It works with multiblock grids
   3. All numerical kernel operations (e.g. computeFluxesOnPatch()) are
      c-based rather than fortran

The included test case is:

   1. octant_3blk - multi block (3 blocks) mapped octant grid 

Note that the numerics for this example have not been fully tested in 2D so it
currently should only run in 3D.
 
COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------

   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      serial:
         ./main test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input

INPUT PARAMETERS
----------------
Refer to test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input for full description of all input
parameters specific to this problem.
