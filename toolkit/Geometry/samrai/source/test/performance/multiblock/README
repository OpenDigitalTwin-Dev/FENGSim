#########################################################################

This example is similar to the single-block AMR LinAdv sample application.
This example has the following differences:

   1. It works on non-cartesian mapped grids
   2. It works with multiblock grids
   3. All numerical kernel operations (e.g. computeFluxesOnPatch()) are
      c-based rather than fortran

The four test cases included are:

   1. test.3d.1blk   - single block Cartesian grid
   2. test.3d.2blk   - two block Cartesian grid
   3. test.3d.4blk   - four block Cartesian grid
   4. test.3d.8blk   - eight block Cartesian grid

Note that the numerics for this example have not been fully tested in 2D so it
currently should only run in 3D.

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      For one of the following input files in performance_inputs:
      serial:
      ./main <input file>
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main <input file>
