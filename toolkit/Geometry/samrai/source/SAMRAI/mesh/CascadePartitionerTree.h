 * @brief A binary-tree of process groups in the CascadePartitioner
 * algorithm.  This class is used internally in the CascadePartioner
 * class.  It should not be used otherwise.
 *
 * In cascade partitioner, the MPI ranks are recursively split into
 * groups, forming the nodes of a binary tree.  The root branch
 * contains all ranks.  The leaves are single-process groups.  Each
 * group is represented by a CascadePartitionerTree.
 *
 * @b Terminology: The root group includes all ranks.  It splits into
 * lower and upper groups (also called branches).  The lower branch
 * has the lower ranks.  If the group has an odd number of ranks, the
 * upper branch has one rank more than the lower.  The branch
 * containing the local process is also known as the "near branch";
 * the one not containing the local process is the "far branch".
