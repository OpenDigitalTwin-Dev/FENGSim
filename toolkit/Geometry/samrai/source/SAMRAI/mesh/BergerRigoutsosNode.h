/*!
 * @brief Node in the asynchronous Berger-Rigoutsos (BR) tree.
 * Do not directly use this class; for clustering, use BergerRigoutsos
 * instead.
 *
 * In mesh generation, the BR algorithm can be used to cluster
 * tagged cells into boxes.
 * This algorithm is described in Berger and Rigoutsos,
 * IEEE Trans. on Sys, Man, and Cyber (21)5:1278-1286.
 *
 * Each tree node is associated with a candidate box,
 * an owner process coordinating distributed computations on the box
 * and a group of processors participating in those computations.
 * Should the candidate box be one of the final output boxes,
 * the owner also owns the graph node associated with the box.
 *
 * To use this class:
 * -# Construct the root node, an object of type
 *    BergerRigoutsosNode.
 * -# Finetune the algorithm settings using the methods under
 *    "Algorithm settings".
 * -# Start clustering by calling clusterAndComputeRelationships().
 *
 * The 2 primary outputs of this implementation are:
 * -# A BoxLevel of Boxes containing input tags.  Each node
 *    corresponds to an output box.
 * -# Connector between the tag BoxLevel and the new BoxLevel.
 *
 * TODO:
 * -# Implement MOST_TAGS ownership option.  This may be an
 *    improvement over the MOST_OVERLAP and is easy to do
 *    because the number of local tags in the candidate box
 *    is already computed.
