 * Class TagAndInitializeStrategy is a base class that defines a
 * Strategy pattern interface for level initialization and cell tagging
 * routines that are needed by the adaptive meshing algorithms provided
 * by the class GriddingAlgorithm.  The class defines an interface to
 * construct refined regions based on a user-supplied set of boxes, but
 * its main role is to provide interfaces for level initialization and
 * cell tagging operations.
 *
 * All methods defined by this class with the exception of getObjectName are
 * abstract and must be supplied by a concrete sub-class of this base class.
 *
 * If user supplied refine boxes are used, they may be supplied through
 * input as defined by specific, concrete sub-classes of this base class.
 * Alternatively, they may be supplied through the "resetRefineBoxes()"
 * method.
 *
 * The virtual methods in this class may place constraints on the patch
 * hierarchy by the particular error estimation procedure in use.  Those
 * constraints and operations must be honored in the concrete subclass
 * implementations of these methods.  The constraints are discussed in
 * the method descriptions below.
