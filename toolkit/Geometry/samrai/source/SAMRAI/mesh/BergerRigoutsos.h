/*!
 * @brief Asynchronous Berger-Rigoutsos implementation.
 * This class is derived from the abstract base class
 * BoxGeneratorStrategy.  Thus, it serves as a concrete
 * implementation of the box generator Strategy pattern interface.
 *
 * This class uses the BergerRigoutsosNode class
 * to carry out the asynchronous Berger-Rigoutsos algorithm.
 * It handles aspects not central to that algorithm.  It:
 * - Implements the box generator Strategy pattern interface.
 * - Provides an interface with the input database for setting
 *   parameters influencing the implementation.
 * - Sorts the output data (if user requests).
 * - Performs some additional error checking.
 * For more details on the parallel implementation,
 * see BergerRigoutsosNode.
 *
 * <b> Input Parameters </b>
 *
 * <b> Definitions: </b>
 *    - \b max_box_size
 *       The maximum cluster size allowed. This parameter is not critical to
 *       clustering but limiting the cluster size may improve performance of
 *       load balancing algorithms (due to the excessive work required by the
 *       owner of huge clusters).
 *
 *    - \b sort_output_nodes
 *       Whether to sort the output. This makes the normally non-deterministic
 *       ordering deterministic and the results repeatable.
 *
 *    - \b check_min_box_size
 *       A flag to control how to resolve an initial box that violates the
 *       minimum box size. Set to one of these strings: <br>
 *       \b "IGNORE" - violations will be quietly disregarded. <br>
 *       \b "WARN" - violations will cause a warning but the code will
 *       continue anyway. <br>
 *       \b "ERROR" - violations will cause an unrecoverable assertion.
 *
 *    - \b    efficiency_tolerance
 *       each value specifies the minimum fraction of tagged cells to total
 *       cells in boxes used to construct patches on a new level.  If the ratio
 *       is below the tolerance value, the box may be split into smaller boxes
 *       and pieces removed until the ratio becomes greater than or equal to
 *       the tolerance.  This tolerance helps users control the amount of extra
 *       refined cells created (beyond those tagged explicitly) that is typical
 *       in patch-based AMR computations.  The index of the value in the array
 *       corresponds to the number of the level to which the tolerance value
 *       applies.  If more values are given than the maximum number of levels
 *       allowed in the hierarchy, extra values will be ignored.  If fewer
 *       values are given, then the last value given will be used for each
 *       level without a specified input value.  For example, if only a single
 *       value is specified, then that value will be used on all levels.
 *
 *    - \b    combine_efficiency
 *       each value serves as a threshold for the ratio of the total number of
 *       cells in two boxes into which a box may be split and the number of
 *       cells in the original box.  If that ratio is greater than the combine
 *       efficiency, the box will not be split.  This tolerance helps users
 *       avoids splitting up portions of the domain into into very small
 *       patches which can increase the overhead of AMR operations.  Multiple
 *       values in the array are handled similar to efficiency_tolerance.

 *
 * @internal The following are developer inputs useful for experimentation.
 * Defaults are listed in parenthesis:
 *
 * @internal DEV_algo_advance_mode ("ADVANCE_SOME")
 * string
 * Asynchronous algorithm advance mode.  The default has been empirically
 * determined to scale best to higher numbers of processors and work
 * adequately for lower numbers of processors.
 *
 * @internal DEV_owner_mode ("MOST_OVERLAP")
 * string
 * How to chose the owner from a node group.
 * This string is used in BergerRigoutsosNode::setOwnerMode().
 *
 * @internal DEV_min_box_size_from_cutting (all members are 0.0)
 * int[]
 * This is an alternative minimum box size.  It helps reduce excessive box
 * cutting.  If used, a good value is a box with about 3-4 times the volume
 * of the minimum size specified by the findBoxesContainingTags() interface.
 *
 * @internal DEV_max_inflection_cut_from_center (1.0)
 * double
 * Limit the Laplace cut to this fraction of the distance from the center
 * plane to the end.  Zero means cut only at the center plane.  One means
 * unlimited.  Under most situations, one is fine.  A lower setting helps
 * prevent parallel slivers.
 *
 * @internal DEV_inflection_cut_threshold_ar (0.0)
 * double
 * Specifies the mininum box thickness that can be cut, as a ratio to the
 * thinnest box direction.  If the box doesn't have any direction thick
 * enough, then it has a reasonable aspect ratio, so we can cut it in any
 * direction.
 * Degenerate values of DEV_inflection_cut_threshold_ar:
 *    1: cut any direction except the thinnest.
 *    (0,1) and huge values: cut any direction.
 *    0: Not a degenerate case but a special case meaning always cut the
 *       thickest direction.  This leads to more cubic boxes but may
 *       prevent cutting at important feature changes.
 *
 * @internal The following are developer inputs for debugging.  Defaults listed
 * in parenthesis:
 *
 * @internal DEV_log_node_history (false)
 * bool
 * Whether to log what certain actions of nodes in the tree.
 * This degrades the performance but is a very useful debugging tool.
 *
 * @internal DEV_log_cluster_summary (false)
 * bool
 * Whether to briefly log the results of the clustering.
 *
 * @internal DEV_log_cluster (false)
 * bool
 * Whether to log the results of the clustering.
 *
 * @internal DEV_build_zero_width_connector (false):
 * Build Connectors with zero between the tag level and the new level,
 * regardless of the width requested by in the interface
 * findBoxesContainingTags().  This forces the calling method to
 * recompute the Connectors with the correct width.  Using this option
 * has some consequences for performance, but whether it is a net gain
 * or loss has not been generally established.
