 * @brief Class PatchHierarchy maintains the patch levels that
 * define the AMR hierarchy.
 *
 * <b> Input Parameters </b> <br>
 * For ratio_to_coarser, smallest_patch_size, and largest_patch_size assume
 * that we have N levels numbered coarsest to finest as 0,..., N-1.  For these
 * inputs, the value for a level must be given as ``level_n = value'' where
 * n is the level number.  When more values are given than needed for the
 * maximum number of levels, extra values are ignored.  When fewer values
 * are given, the last value provided will be used on each level without a
 * specified input value.  See example input below.
 *
 * <b> Definitions: </b>
 *   - \b    max_levels
 *      specifies maximum number of levels allowed in the AMR patch hierarchy.
 *
 *   - \b    ratio_to_coarser
 *      A set of max_levels - 1 integer arrays each with length = DIM, each of
 *      which indicates the ratio of the index space of a patch level to that
 *      of the next coarser level in the hierarchy.  The input is given for
 *      each level n, where n (= 1, 2,..., N-1) is the level number.
 *
 *   - \b    smallest_patch_size
 *      A set of max_levels integer vectors each with length = DIM, each of
 *      which indicates the size of smallest patch allowed on the level in the
 *      hierarchy.  The smallest patch allowed must be at least as large as the
 *      maximum ghost cell width for all variables in the problem.  If some
 *      smaller patch size is given in input, then it will be overridden by the
 *      maximum ghost width.  If no input is given, a default of the maximum
 *      ghost cell width over all variables is used.  The input is given for
 *      each level n, where n (= 0, 1,..., N-1) is the level number.
 *
 *   - \b    largest_patch_size
 *      A set of max_levels integer vectors each with length = DIM, each of
 *      which indicates the size of largest patch allowed on the level in the
 *      hierarchy.  Negative values for patch size corresponds to no upper
 *      limit on patch size.  The input is given for each level n, where
 *      n (= 0, 1,..., N-1) is the level number.
 *
 *   - \b    minimum_cell_request
 *      A set of max_levels integers, each of which indicates a desired
 *      minimum total cell count for the patches on each level.  This is
 *      enforced in addition to smallest_patch_size, which sets dimension-
 *      based minimums on the patch size.  Strict enforcement of the
 *      minimum_cell_request is not guaranteed, as other parameters
 *      and algorithmic restrictions may cause some patches to have a size
 *      smaller than this requested minimum.  The input is given for each level
 *      n, where n (= 0, 1,..., N-1) is the level number.
 *
 *   - \b    proper_nesting_buffer
 *      A set of max_levels - 1 integer values specifying the number of coarse
 *      cells by which the next finer level is nested within the interior of
 *      the union of the patches on the next coarser level.  The input is given
 *      for each level n, where n (= 0, 1,..., N-2) is the level number.
 *
 *    - \b    allow_patches_smaller_than_ghostwidth
 *      indicates whether patches are allowed that are smaller than the maximum
 *      variable ghost width along some coordinate direction.  Recall that when
 *      a smallest patch size provided in the input file is smaller than the
 *      maximum ghost width of all the registered variables, then by default
 *      the smallest patch size will be set to the maximum ghost width.  Set
 *      this flag to TRUE to override this default behavior and to allow the
 *      smallest patch size given in the input to remain in effect.
 *
 *    - \b    allow_patches_smaller_than_minimum_size_to_prevent_overlaps
 *      indicates whether patches are allowed to be smaller than the minimum
 *      patch size to prevent overlapping patches.  In order to enforce minimum
 *      patch size restrictions, boxes may be grown during adaptive gridding
 *      operations.  This may lead to patches whose boxes overlap.  This may be
 *      a problem for some applications. If overlaps are undesirable and you
 *      are willing to relax the minimum size constraints, set this parameter
 *      TRUE.

    *  Specifically, it is not clear how one actually determines the
    *  correct width information to provide.  Also, the documentation
    *  alludes to usage that is internal to SAMRAI (e.g., the stuff about
    *  GriddingAlgorithm) so it is not clear what a user needs to do
    *  and what she does not.
    *
    *  The notion of "connector width" does not appear to be defined
    *  anywhere.  If is is, where is the definition?
    */
   /*!
    * @brief Abstract base class defining a Strategy pattern interface
    * for providing Connector width information to the PatchHierarchy.
    *
    * The hierarchy needs to know that Connector width constraints
    * must be applied so it can provide correct connector width information
    * to mesh generation operations so that they can generate Connectors
    * with sufficient widths.  It is most efficient (scales better) to
    * generate overlap Connectors when the mesh is built rather than searching
    * for overlaps later.  If the required widths are not set up this way,
    * or if the code building the hierarchy does not provide Connectors
    * of sufficient widths, SAMRAI will still work but will not scale
    * well.  The mechanism for generating missing Connectors as needed
    * is in the class PersistentOverlapConnectors.
    *
    * The user of a PatchHierarchy object registers implementations of
    * this strategy class with the PatchHierarchy.  See
    * PatchHierarchy::registerConnectorWidthRequestor().
    * By default, requesters implemented by the SAMRAI library will be
    * automatically registered. Unless you want to provide your own
    * requesters, no special action is required.
    *
    * TODO: The following paragraph is more confusing than helpful.
    * It exposes internal SAMRAI implementation details and confuses
    * what a user needs to do.
    *
    * When the hierarchy is first asked for any required width, it
    * uses the registered implementations to compute all required
    * widths.  After that, no further registration is allowed.
    * Implementations of this class usually requires the max ghost
    * data width and the max stencil widths, so it is best to make
    * sure that those have been registered before doing something that
    * calls getRequiredConnectorWidth(), such as using
    * mesh::GriddingAlgorithm to populate the hierarchy with a level.
    *
    * Example of a typical scenario: GriddingAlgorithm is used to
    * build the hierarchy.  Two classes that will want the hierarchy's
    * Connectors to have some specified widths are GriddingAlgorithm
    * and RefineSchedule.  This strategy should therefore be
    * implemented by GriddingAlgorithm and RefineSchedule.
