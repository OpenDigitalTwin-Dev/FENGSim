/**
 * Class PatchData is a pure virtual base class for the data storage
 * defined over a box.  Patch data objects are generally contained within
 * a patch.  Patch data defines the abstract virtual functions for data
 * management and communication that must be supplied by the subclasses.
 * Subclasses implement the virtual functions as appropriate for the derived
 * type; for example, cell centered objects will copy data differently than
 * face centered objects.
 *
 * Patch data objects are created by patch data factories and associated
 * subclasses.  This separation into abstract factory and concrete
 * implementation subclasses facilitates the creation of new patch data
 * subtypes.  See the Design Patterns book for more details about the
 * Abstract Factory pattern.
 *
 * The copy and pack/unpack functions in the patch data object take
 * box overlap descriptions that describe the index space over which
 * data is to be copied or packed/unpacked.  Box overlaps are computed
 * by the box geometry classes, which are accessed through the patch
 * data factories.  Box geometry classes are created by the patch data
 * factories instead of the patch data objects because patch data objects
 * are distributed across memory with patches and therefore may not exist
 * on a particular processor.  Patch data factories are guaranteed to
 * exist on all processors independent of the patch-to-processor mapping.
