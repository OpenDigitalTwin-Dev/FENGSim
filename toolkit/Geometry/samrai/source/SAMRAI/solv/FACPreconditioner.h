/*!
 * @brief Implements the FAC iterative solution procedure
 * for a linear system of equations, Au=f, defined
 * on some subset of levels in an AMR patch hierarchy.
 *
 * The solution is found by applying an FAC algorithm
 * to the composite grid represented in the hierarchy.
 * After each FAC cycle the norm of the residual will be computed over
 * all levels involved.  The FAC iteration will stop when either the
 * maximum number of iterations is reached, or the residual norm on
 * all levels is below the given tolerance.
 *
 * The user must perform the following steps to use the FAC solver:
 * -# Create a FACPreconditioner, providing a valid concrete
 *    FACOperatorStrategy object.
 * -# Set the stopping criteria using the setStoppingParameters() function.
 * -# Set the number of smooting sweeps using the setSmoothingSweeps()
 *    function.  This is optional; if not used, the default is one sweep
 *    in each case.
 * -# Enable logging to record the FAC residual norms during the FAC
 *    itertion using the setFACLogFlag() function.  This is optional;
 *    the default is to turn logging off.  When loggin is turned on, the
 *    default mode is to send this information to the application log
 *    file (i.e., plog).
 * -# Invoke the FAC iteration process by calling solveSystem(),
 *    providing the vectors u and f, defined on a patch hierarchy
 *    containing the desired range of levels.
 * -# After solving, get solver statistics by viewing the log information
 *    and calling getNumberOfIterations(), getResidualNorm() functions
 *    if desired.
