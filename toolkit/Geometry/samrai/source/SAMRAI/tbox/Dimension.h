/**
 * Class Dimension is used to represent the dimension of a SAMRAI
 * object.
 *
 * The maximum dimension is set at compile time using a flag to the
 * configure script.  This is used to allocate arrays in some lower
 * level classes such as IntVector.  If dynamic memory allocation is
 * used the performance impact is significant; a maximum dimension
 * allows for stack based memory allocation in performance critical
 * classes at the expense of wasting storage for objects with
 * dimension less than the maximum dimension.
 *
 * A class is used rather than a simple short or integer to provide
 * enhanced type safety.
