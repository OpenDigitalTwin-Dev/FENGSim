 * @brief Supports point-to-point asynchronous communication
 * operations that can overlap other communcations using a
 * AsyncCommStage.
 *
 * To use this class:
 *
 * -# Construct an object with a stage or @c initialize() it with a
 *    stage.
 *
 * -# Set the MPI communicator and tag values for use in the MPI
 *    nonblocking message passing functions.
 *
 * -# Set the peer rank using setPeerRank().
 *
 * -# Call the beginSend() and beginRecv() functions.  Make sure
 *    there is a matching call on the peer processor.
 *
 * -# Use the stage to advance the message passing operations.  The
 *    stage tells you which members have completed their operations.
 *
 * -# Received data can be accessed using getRecvSize() and getRecvData().
 *
 * It is not neccesary to know how much data is being sent.  This
 * class will figure that out (using overhead data attached to the
 * actual user data being communicated).
 *
 * To check on sends and receives without using the stage, use
 * checkSend() and checkRecv() or proceedToNextWait().  To wait for
 * the current operation to complete, use completeCurrentOperation().
