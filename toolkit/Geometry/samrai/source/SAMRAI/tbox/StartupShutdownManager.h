/*!
 * @brief Class StartupShutdownManager is a utility for managing
 * callbacks invoked at program and problem startup and completion.
 *
 * There are four steps in the lifecycle of managed objects.
 *
 * An object is initialized once at the start of a run and a
 * corresponding finalization is done once at the end of the run.
 * These methods can be used to create and destroy static state that
 * is independent of problem; e.g., when running multiple problems
 * during a single program (i.e., main) execution.
 *
 * The lifecycle also has a startup/shutdown step.   This is invoked
 * at least once per run but may be invoked multiple times if
 * multiple SAMRAI problems are being run within a single execution of the
 * main function.  These methods should setup/teardown any state that
 * is problem dependent.
 *
 * In order to address dependencies between classes a Handler provides
 * a priority (ordering) using the getPriority method.  Ordering within
 * the same priority is undefined.
 *
 * The StartupShutdowManger::AbstractHandler defines the interface for
 * the class that is registered.  StartupShutdowManger::Handler is a
 * helper class provided to simplify the use of the StartupShutdownManager.
 * One may simply create a static instance of the Handler class, providing
 * the constructor with callbacks to invoke and priority to use.
 *
 * The StartupShutdownManger is normally managed by the SAMRAIManager
 * class.

    * This class is provided to simplify construction of a
    * handler class for standard SAMRAI startup/shutdown uses.  This
    * handler registers itself with the StartupShutdownManager on
    * construction.  On construction the methods to invoke for each
    * step of the lifecycle are supplied.  The method may be 0
    * indicating that the managed class does not require anything to
    * be executed at that step.
    *
    * Example usage shows how the static initialization of the
    * s_startup_shutdown_handler is used to provide a simple
    * method of registering a class with the manager that requires
    * startup and shutdown but not initialization or finalization.

    * public:

    *    }

    * static variables in template classes are only initialized if
    * used.  For template classes a slightly different mechanism using
    * a static in a method is used.  Similar to the Meyer singleton
    * implementation.  This method has the disadvantage of having to check
    * on each object construction if the static has been created (it is
    * done under the hood by the compiler but still exists).  At this
    * time we are not aware of a method to invoke a block of code only
    * once for a template class.
