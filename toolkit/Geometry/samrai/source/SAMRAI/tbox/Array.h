 * Class Array<TYPE> defines a smart pointer to an array of TYPE and

 * if the data was originally allocated from an arena).  When the
 * reference count on a Array<TYPE> object goes to zero, the array
 * objects are automatically deallocated.  The array class frees the
 * user from deleting and tracking aliases for object arrays.
 *
 * A block with references count and arena pointer is allocated for
 * all non-empty arrays.  These reference counted blocks are freed at
 * the end of the lifetime of the array.
 *
 * Class TYPE must define a copy constructor and an assignment

    * \code

    * Arrays when the elements are known to be assigned to some value
    * after construction and thus does not need to be initialized.  A
    * loop over the array elements doing an assiggment to the
    * default_value is avoided.
