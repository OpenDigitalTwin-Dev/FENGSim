/// \brief A class that points to and access and array of data.
///
/// The ArrayPortal class itself does not exist; this code is provided for
/// documentation purposes only.
///
/// An ArrayPortal object acts like a pointer to a random-access container
/// (that is, an array) and also lets you set and get values in that array. In
/// many respects an ArrayPortal is similar in concept to that of iterators but
/// with a much simpler interface and no internal concept of position.
/// Otherwise, ArrayPortal objects may be passed and copied around so that
/// multiple entities may be accessing the same array.
///
/// An ArrayPortal differs from an ArrayHandle in that the ArrayPortal is a
/// much lighterweight object and that it does not manage things like
/// allocation and control/execution sharing. An ArrayPortal also differs from
/// a Storage in that it does not actually contain the data but rather
/// points to it. In this way the ArrayPortal can be copied and passed and
/// still point to the same data.
///
/// Most VTKm users generally do not need to do much or anything with
/// ArrayPortal objects. It is mostly an internal mechanism. However, an
/// ArrayPortal can be used to pass constant input data to an ArrayHandle.
///
/// Although portals are defined in the execution environment, they are also
/// used in the control environment for accessing data on the host.
///
