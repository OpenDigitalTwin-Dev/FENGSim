# This script, which is run as part of a target, uses pyexpander to do
# macro substitution on an input file and checks the result with the

# error message is printed with further instructions.

# To use this script, the CMake variables PYTHON_EXECUTABLE PYEXPANDER_COMMAND,
# SOURCE_FILE, and GENERATED_FILE must be defined as the two files to compare.
# A ".in" is appended to SOURCE_FILE to get the pyexpander input.
