// COMMENTS:
//
// After the core join tree is constructed, we need to assign each vertex to a join superarc
// This was previously done with a set of rocking iterations, which burned extra memory and
// work.  The OpenMP version was therefore updated so that each vertex looped until it found
// it's destination arc.
//
// This functor implements that for use by a for_each call.
//
// Any vector needed by the functor for lookup purposes will be passed as a parameter to
// the constructor and saved, with the actual function call being the operator ()
//
// Vectors marked I/O are intrinsically risky unless there is an algorithmic guarantee
// that the read/writes are completely independent - which for our case actually occurs
// The I/O vectors should therefore be justified in comments both here & in caller
//
