/// \brief Class that manages data in the execution environment.
///
/// This templated class must be partially specialized for each
/// DeviceAdapterTag crated, which will define the implementation for that tag.
///
/// This is a class that is responsible for allocating data in the execution
/// environment and copying data back and forth between control and
/// execution. It is also expected that this class will automatically release
/// any resources in its destructor.
///
/// This class typically takes on one of two forms. If the control and
/// execution environments have seperate memory spaces, then this class
/// behaves how you would expect. It allocates/deallocates arrays and copies
/// data. However, if the control and execution environments share the same
/// memory space, this class should delegate all its operations to the
/// \c Storage. The latter can probably be implemented with a
/// trivial subclass of
/// vtkm::cont::internal::ArrayManagerExecutionShareWithControl.
