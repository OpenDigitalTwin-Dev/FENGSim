/// \brief Class for transporting from the control to the execution environment.
///
/// The \c Transport class is used to transport data of a certain type from the
/// control environment to the execution environment. It is used internally in
/// VTK-m's dispatch mechanism.
///
/// \c Transport is a templated class with three arguments. The first argument
/// is a tag declaring the mechanism of transport. The second argument is the
/// type of data to transport. The third argument is device adapter tag for
/// the device to move the data to.
///
/// There is no generic implementation of \c Transport. There are partial
/// specializations of \c Transport for each mechanism supported. If you get a
/// compiler error about an incomplete type for \c Transport, it means you used
/// an invalid \c TransportTag or it is an invalid combination of data type or
/// device adapter.

  /// argument. This might be useful for checking the sizes of input data. The
  /// third argument is the size of the output domain, which can be used, for
